## Body:
<p>classics available in English, in approximate order of prerequisites required:</p>

<p>Koblitz' book on p-adic analysis.</p>

<p>Borevich and Shafarevich introduction to theory of numbers.</p>

<p>Cassels' textbook on local fields in the blue LMS series.</p>

<p>Serre's book on local fields.</p>

<p>There are newer books interpolating between these in difficulty, but those were at least until recently the canonized choices.</p>

<p>For more advanced material, ability to read French is indispensable.  Works in French on p-adic number theory, analysis, cohomology, differential equations, etc may actually outnumber those in English.</p>
