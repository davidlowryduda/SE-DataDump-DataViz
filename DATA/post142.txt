<p>I just want to point out that you can generalize your almost polylog-smooth numbers a bit further:  You do not require that the remaining factor is prime, you just require that it is easy to factor.  So, for example, if your time bound is $ln^A x$, you can have the remaining factor be of size M where
   $ln^A x = exp( (\frac{4}{9^{1/3}} + o(1)) (ln M)^{1/3} (ln ln M)^{2/3} )$
or
   $M = o( exp(\frac{9}{64} A^3 (ln ln x)^3) )$.
The average distance of this almost polylog-smooth set S in a neighborhood of x is then approximately the average distance of the polylog-smooth set S' in a neighborhood of x' = x/M.  Note that this only gives a lower bound; $G_S(x) \geq G_{S&#39;}(x&#39;)$.</p>
