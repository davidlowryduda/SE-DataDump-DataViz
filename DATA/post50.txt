<p>Yes, every ideal class contains a split prime.  Here is one possible proof, which however doesn't satisfy the conditions of part B of your question:
the analogue of Dirichlet's argument, using ideal class characters, shows that
$\sum_{\mathfrak p \in [I]} N\mathfrak p^{-1}$ (the sum being taken over prime ideals in the class of $I$) diverges.  On the other hand, the sum over non-split primes converges (because a non-split prime lying over $p$ has norm at least
$p^2$, and so the sum over non-split primes is majorized by (some constant times)
$\sum_p p^{-2}$, which converges).  Thus there must be infinitely many split primes contributing to this sum.</p>

<p>Note: As the OP points out in a comment below, this argument applies only in the Galois case, and so doesn't actually address the question. </p>
