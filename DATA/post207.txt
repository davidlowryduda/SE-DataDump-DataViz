## Body:
<p>I am currently trying to compute homology groups of general linear groups over the ring of integers of an imaginary quadratic number field. As I would like to check my results I would like to know if anybody knows a reference where I can find the integral homology of the $\mathrm{GL}_2$ over the Gaussian integers (or over the Eisenstein integers or some other ring of integers of an imaginary quadratic number field).</p>

<p>I already googled quite a lot but no useful results turned up.</p>

<p>Thank you for your help.</p>
