<p>There is the famous example of J.-P. Serre: determine all rational points on
$$
x^4 + y^4 = 17.
$$
I am not sure if it is solved. Of course, there are the obvious rational solutions, $(\pm 1,\pm 2)$ and $(\pm2,\pm1)$, but we (and you) want to know all rational solutions. 
In general, there is no software to determine this (there is "Sage", for example, for doing such computations, but it need not give all solutions).</p>
