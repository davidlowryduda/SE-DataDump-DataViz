<p>Assuming that a person has taken standard undergraduate math courses (algebra, analysis, point-set topology), what other things he must know before he can understand the Langlands program and its geometric analogue?</p>

<p>What are the good books for learning these topics?</p>

<p>Is there any book which can explain the Langlands program to an undergraduate with very few prerequisites?</p>
