## Body:
<p>Since it is particularly easy to write down a basis of a Kummer extension $K=k(\mu)/k$ (where $\mu^n=a \in k$) as a $k$-vector space, I suspect that it is should not be terribly hard to write an explicit formula for a norm of an element in terms of its coordinates in this basis.</p>

<p>Is there a standard text where this derivation is carried out?</p>
