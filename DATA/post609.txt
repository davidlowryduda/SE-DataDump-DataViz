<p>Does anyone know an "elementary" proof of the following theorem?</p>

<p>Let $k \neq 0$ be a rational integer. Then $k$ admits a square root in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ if $k = 4^a (8b+1)$ for some $a \in \mathbb{N}$, $b \in \mathbb{Z}$.</p>

<p>About $p$-adic numbers I don't know anything more sophisticated than Hensel lemma. Thank you!</p>
