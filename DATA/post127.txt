<p>I tried to google for <a href="http://google.com/#&amp;q=%22euclid%27s+lemma%22+%22divides+neither%22" rel="nofollow">"euclid's lemma" "divides neither"</a>.  It seems that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_lemma" rel="nofollow">wikipedia</a> provides similar proof in the part "Alternate proof without BÃ©zout's identity", but it does not give a reference. Also <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.5866" rel="nofollow">this</a> paper contains a proof similar to yours, but not exactly the same. </p>

<p>I was about to suggest to ask the editor which contributed this proof to wikipedia article about the source, but it seems that this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euclid%27s_lemma&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=335989446&amp;oldid=332202525" rel="nofollow">edit</a> was anonymous. I think that if you find a textbook containing this proof, it would be a good idea to add it as a reference to wikipedia article.</p>
