<p>I am trying to find some work done on the following: $$\sum_{d \vert n}\frac{2^{\omega(d)}}{d}\mu(d)$$ where $\omega(d)$ is the number of distinct prime factors of $d$ and $\mu$ is the Möbius function. I saw something about $$\sum_{d \vert n}\frac{\mu(d)}{d}=\phi(n)/n$$ (where $\phi$ is the Euler phi function) on planetmath, but I'm not entirely certain how to use it. Does anyone know of any work done on the first sum?</p>
