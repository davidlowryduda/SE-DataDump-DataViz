<p>Let $x$ be a unit in $\mathbb Z/ n \mathbb Z$ of multiplicative order $m$.
I am trying to determine when it is that 
$$
\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} x^i \equiv 0 \mod n .
$$
Is this kind of situation something that has been studied? If so, I would be very interested in any suggestions of books that discuss this kind of problem.</p>
