<p>While reading "Rational Points on Elliptic Curves" by Silverman and Tate, I came across this interesting passage about Bachet's duplication formula:</p>

<p>I know how to derive Bachet's duplication formula using the tangent method (namely, one constructs a tangent line to a given rational point on this cubic. The third intersection point of the line and the cubic gives the new rational point). My question is about the mysterious $-432$.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why is it true that if the original rational solution $(x, y)$ has $xy\neq 0$ and if
  $c\neq 1, -432$, then repeating this process leads to infinitely many
  distinct solutions?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Edit.</strong>  Later in the book (page 24), there is a explicit calculation that puts the cubic $u^3+v^3=\alpha$ into Weierstrass Normal Form. The resulting equation is $y^2=x^3-432\alpha^2$. So in particular, $y^2=x^3-432$ is Weierstrass Normal Form of $x^3+y^3=1$. So perhaps this explains the appearance of $-432$ above?</p>
