<p>A positive integer is <em>$B$-smooth</em> if and only if all of its prime divisors are less than or equal to a positive real $B$. For example, the $3$-smooth integers are of the form $2^{a} 3^{b}$ with non-negative exponents $a$ and $b$, and those integers less than or equal to $20$ are $\{1,2,3,4,6,8,9,12,16,18\}$.</p>

<p>In Ramanujan's first letter to G. H. Hardy, Ramanujan emphatically quotes (without proof) his result on the number of $3$-smooth integers less than or equal to $N &gt; 1$,
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\log 2 N \ \log 3N}{2 \log 2 \ \log 3}.
\end{eqnarray}
This is an amazingly accurate approximation, as it differs from the exact value by less than 3 for the first $2^{1000} \approx 1.07 \times 10^{301}$ integers, as shown by Pillai. </p>

<p><em>Question</em>: Knowing full well that Ramanujan only gave proofs of his own claims while working in England, I wonder if a proof of this particular estimate appears somewhere in the literature. Is this problem still open? If not, what is a reference discussing its proof?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
