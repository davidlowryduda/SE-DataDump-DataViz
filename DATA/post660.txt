<p>Subtract the first equation from the second.</p>

<p>Express $y$ in terms of $z$</p>

<p>Now substitute into the first equation and you'll get and relation for $x$ with respect for $z$. </p>

<p>Because $z \in \mathbb{R}$ there are infinite amount of solutions and all of them are of a closed form, you'll obtain. And this is the fastest way to compute solution, maybe you were confused, because there are infinite amount of them.</p>
