## Title:
Has the $\Gamma$-like function $f_p(n) = 1^{\ln(1)^p} \cdot 2^{\ln(2)^p} \cdot \ldots \cdot n^{\ln(n)^p} $ been discussed anywhere?

<p>In an older fiddling with the gamma-function (expanding on the idea of sums of consecutive like-powers of logarithms, similarly as the bernoulli-polynomials for the sums of like powers of consecutive integers) I hadn't looked at the assumed approximations for the family of <em>p</em>-parametrized gamma-relatives (where p is nonnegative integer)
$$ \begin{align} f_p(n) &amp; =\exp \left(\sum_{k=0}^n \ln(1+k)^p \right) \\ &amp; = 1^{\ln(1)^{p-1}}\cdot 2^{\ln(2)^{p-1}} \cdots n^{\ln(n)^{p-1}} \end{align}$$ 
where $p \gt 1$       .</p>

<p>I just looked at that treatize and would like to improve it with some knowlegde about the functions $f_p$ where $p \gt 1$ (for $p=1$ this is the factorial function).     </p>

<p>Q: Has someone seen one of these functions being discussed elsewhere?</p>
