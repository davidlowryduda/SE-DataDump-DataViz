<p>Let $K$ be a number field. Let $\mathbb{I}_f$ denote the group of finite ideles, and let $\phi: K^{\times} \rightarrow \mathbb{I}_f$ be the diagonal embedding. On page 167 of his notes on Class Field Theory, Milne states the following result without proof:</p>

<p><strong>"The induced topology on $K^{\times}$ has the following description: $U_K = \mathcal{O}_K^{\times}$ is open, and a fundamental system of neighborhoods of $1$ is formed by the subgroups of $U_K$ of finite index."</strong></p>

<p>Can someone point me to a source where this is proved, or outline an argument for a proof of this theorem if it is not too much trouble.</p>
