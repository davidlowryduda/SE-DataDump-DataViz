<p>The right book, of course, depends on your background.  </p>

<p>"P-adic Analysis compared with Real," by Svetlana Katok is a very gentle introduction to p-adic numbers.  This text is suitable for an undergrad who has taken some analysis and topology.</p>

<p>"A Course in p-adic analysis," by Alain Robert is a more terse and advanced book on the subject.  It is nicely written as well, but it takes much more background to learn from the book.</p>
