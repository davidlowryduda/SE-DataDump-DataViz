## Body:
<p>When I am faced with a simple linear congruence such as 
$$9x \equiv 7 \pmod{13}$$
and I am working without any calculating aid handy, I tend to do something like the following:</p>

<p>"Notice" that adding $13$ on the right and subtracting $13x$ on the left gives:
$$-4x \equiv 20 \pmod{13}$$</p>

<p>so that $$x \equiv -5 \equiv 8 \pmod{13}.$$</p>

<p>Clearly this process works and is easy to justify (apart from not having an algorithm for "noticing"), but my question is this: I have a vague recollection of reading somewhere this sort of process was the preferred method of C. F. Gauss, but I cannot find any evidence for this now, so does anyone know anything about this, or could provide a reference? (Or have I just imagined it all?)</p>

<p>I would also be interested to hear if anyone else does anything similar.</p>
