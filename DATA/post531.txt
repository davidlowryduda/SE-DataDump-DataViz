<p>I think you are looking for <em>numeration systems</em>. In the book <a href="http://amzn.com/0521823323" rel="nofollow">Automatic Sequences</a> by Allouche and Shallit there is a chapter on numeration systems. From the introduction of Chapter 3:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this chapter, we discuss how numbers can be represented by strings over a finite 
  alphabet. Our emphasis is on the representation of integers, although we briefly 
  discuss representations for real numbers in Section 3.4.</p>
  
  <p>We start with the classical base-$k$ representation, and then discuss less familiar 
  representations such as representation in base $-k$ , Fibonacci representation, and 
  representation in complex bases.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I haven't had time to read this chapter yet, but it seems to contain a lot of information. 57 pages, 61 exercises and discussion of 8 open problems. This might just be the place to start if you want to know more.</p>
