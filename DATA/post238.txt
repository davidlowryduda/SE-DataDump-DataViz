<p>EDIT: From the Wikipedia essay on congruent numbers, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congruent_number#Congruent_number_problem" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congruent_number#Congruent_number_problem</a>, we get "a positive rational number $n$ is congruent if and only if the equation $y^2 = x^3 - n^2x$ has a rational point with $y$ not equal to $0$ ... the existence of a rational point with $y$ nonzero is equivalent to saying the elliptic curve has positive rank ... if $p$ is a prime number then
if $p \equiv 3 \pmod8$, then $p$ is not a congruent number...." </p>

<p>Putting this together, if $p=8k+3$ is prime, then $y^2=x^3-p^2x$ has rank zero. </p>

<p>It is safe to ignore the following paragraphs, left over from an earlier attempt. </p>

<p>Ken Ono, Rank zero quadratic twists of modular elliptic curves, <a href="http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~ono/publications-cv/pdfs/014.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~ono/publications-cv/pdfs/014.pdf</a>, proves that if $E$ is defined by $y^2=x^3-1$, and $r$ is 1, 2, 5, 10, 13, 14, 17, or 22, then there are infinitely many positive squarefree integers $D\equiv r\pmod{24}$ such that $E_D$, the $D$-quadratic twist of $E$, has rank zero. </p>

<p>I guess this isn't exactly what you want, as it doesn't specify which integers $D$ work and which do not, but still there may be something in that paper which will be of use to you. </p>
