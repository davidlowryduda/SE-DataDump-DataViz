<p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_%28group%29#See_also" rel="nofollow">lattice</a> in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a discrete subgroup that spans $\mathbb{R}^n$. Recently I've been running into a similar sort of object consisting of more than $n$ vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and their $\mathbb{Z}$-linear combinations.</p>

<p>I think this is best seen via an example.</p>

<p>Consider the boring lattice generated by $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$. This is the good ol' standard coordinate lattice we know and love. </p>

<p>Now look at the 'non-discrete lattice' generated by $(1,0), (0,1), (1,\sqrt 2)$. This is not a discrete subgroup of $\mathbb{R}^2$ because it's 'horizontally dense,' i.e. if $(x,y)$ is in the 'lattice,' then there are infinitely many other points in $(x\pm \epsilon, y)$ in the 'lattice.' This is very different than the non-disrete lattice generated by $(1,0), (0,1), (\sqrt 2, \sqrt 2)$, which is everywhere dense.</p>

<p>These examples are a bit contrived, but in higher dimensions/more general fields, I have a hard time determining the resulting characteristics of the 'lattice.' For example, is it easy to tell how 'dense' the resulting 'lattice' is? Does this come up/are there known applications of this to, say, number theory? </p>

<p>To be specific:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Is there a name for the concept of what I've been calling a 'non-discrete lattice?'</li>
  <li>Can you point me to reference material on 'non-discrete lattices?'</li>
  </ol>
