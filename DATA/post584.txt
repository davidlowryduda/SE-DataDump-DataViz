<p>1.) We have 
$$
\left(\frac{x}{z}\right)^2+\left(\frac{y}{z}\right)^2=n,
$$
so the answer is given by Fermatâ€™s two square theorem for rationals:</p>

<p><strong>Theorem (Fermat):</strong> A positive rational number is a sum of two rational squares if and only if in its prime factorization every prime of the form $4k + 3$ appears with an even exponent.</p>

<p>For proofs see <a href="http://mathoverflow.net/questions/88539/sums-of-rational-squares">http://mathoverflow.net/questions/88539/sums-of-rational-squares</a>.</p>

<p>2.) See the references given here: <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/368756/proof-of-hasse-minkowski-over-number-field">Proof of Hasse-Minkowski over Number Field</a>. I would say, "J.P. Serre: A course in arithmetic" is a good source.</p>
