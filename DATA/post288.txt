<p>Here are <a href="http://www.stud.uni-hannover.de/~mschepke/tex/schepke_algebraic_number_theory.pdf" rel="nofollow">lecture notes</a> of a number theory course in Cambridge written by Markus Schepke.
Theorem 20 and Proposition 21 are essentially proposition 5.11 in Cox's book. However the author of your paper only uses a small corollary of the proposition, which is easy to prove on its own: </p>

<p>Let $L=K(\alpha)/K$ with $\alpha\in\mathcal{O}_L$ be an extension of number fields, $p$ a prime of $K$. If the minimal polynomial of $\alpha,~m_\alpha(x)$ is irreducible over $\mathcal{O}_K/p$, then $p$ is inert.</p>

<p><strong>Proof:</strong> Let $q$ be a prime of $L$ above $p$. Then $\mathcal{O}_L/q$ contains the image of $\alpha$, a root of $m_\alpha(x)\mod p$ and hence $[L:K]\geq f_{q/p}=[\mathcal{O}_L/q:\mathcal{O}_K/p]\geq\deg m_\alpha(x)=[L:K]$. So $q$ is the only prime above $p$.</p>

<p><strong>Remark:</strong> For the first inequality above and the conclusion you can use Theorem 19 in the lecture notes I sent you. If $p\mathcal{O}_L=\prod_i q_i^{e_i}$, then 
$$
[L:K]=\sum_i e_{q_i/p}f_{q_i/p}.
$$</p>
