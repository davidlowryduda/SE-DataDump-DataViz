## Body:
<p>John Friedlander and  Henryk Iwaniec wrote a book  <em><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0821849700" rel="nofollow">Opera De Cribro</a></em>. 
How about this book? What's the meaning of its title?  A number theory book with such a title seems odd.</p>

<p>p.s.  I have no way to buy this book or borrow a copy at the moment, so I want to learn some information about  it.</p>
