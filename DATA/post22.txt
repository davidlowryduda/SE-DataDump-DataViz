<p>Does anyone know a good book for learning about linear forms in logarithms especially one that is motivated by solving Diophantine equations with it? I know there's a chapter in Langs book but it doesn't have any applications so that's not the sort of thing I was looking for. Thanks very much for any recommendations!</p>
