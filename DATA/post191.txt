<p>There is a proof of this statement <a href="http://math.arizona.edu/~savitt/mathcamp/1999/primitive_roots.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a> (see Theorem 4.4), but I cannot find this result in any of my number theory textbooks.  Does anyone know of a textbook that proves this result? Moreover, does anyone know the origin of this result?</p>
