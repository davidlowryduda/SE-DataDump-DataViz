Why is $a\equiv b \pmod n$   equivalent to the congruences $a\equiv  b,b+n,b+2n,\dots,b+(c-1)n\pmod {cn}$?

<p>I learned the following proposition (in which there is no proof) in a GRE math preparation book. I don't understand what it means and I am not able to find any theorem about this statement in Hardy's <em>An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For any positive integer $c$, the
   statement $a\equiv b \pmod n$ is
   equivalent to the congruences $a\equiv
 b,b+n,b+2n,\dots,b+(c-1)n\pmod {cn}.$</p>

<p>I cannot even apply this proposition to an example such as $7\equiv 1\pmod 6$. If the above is true, then </p>

<p>$$7\equiv 1,7,13,19\pmod{24}$$
which is obvious not true. </p>

<p>Is there any typo here? Or how should I understand this "proposition"?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: This question may be related to the question <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/q/46017/9464">here</a>. </p>
