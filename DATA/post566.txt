<p>From the Math.Sci.Net review: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is a survey, largely without proofs, of recent work of the author, done partly in collaboration
  with D. B. Zagier, on the geometry of the Hilbert modular surface(s) associated to a real quadratic
  ﬁeld, concentrating particularly on the appearance therein of class numbers.</p>

<p>... and later in the review ...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He then introduces the Hilbert modular surfaces: the compactiﬁed and resolved quotients of the
  actions of congruence subgroups of SL2 over the integers of the real quadratic ﬁeld, acting on H ×
  H. He sketches the results [op. cit.] about the signature of the quotient and how, as a consequence
  of all of the foregoing considerations, one is able to express, for a prime p of form 4m − 1, p > 3,
  the class number of the quadratic ﬁeld of discriminant −p in terms of the period of the continued
  fraction for $p^{1/2}$ whenever the class number of the quadratic ﬁeld of discriminant 4p is one.</p>
