## Body:
<p>It is known that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J-invariant" rel="nofollow">$j$-function</a> takes algebraic values when evaluated at imaginary quadratic integers. This is a result that was proved by Schneider in 1937 apparently. To be precise, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J-invariant#Transcendence_properties" rel="nofollow">Schneider proved</a> that</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>If $z \in \mathbb{H} = \{ z \in \mathbb{C} \mid \Im{(z)} &gt; 0  \}$ and $j(z)$ is an algebraic integer. Then $z$ is algebraic if and only if $z$ is an imaginary quadratic integer.</p>

<p>I would really appreciate if someone can provide me some nice reference(s) where this result is proved. </p>

<p>Thank you very much for any help.</p>
