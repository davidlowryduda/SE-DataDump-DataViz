<p>I am looking for references on the trace formula, by which I mean the Selberg trace formula and its successor the Arthur-Selberg trace formula.</p>

<p>I am aware that there are "standard references" on the subject, and I have looked at some of those standard references.  However, I am not necessarily looking for a "standard reference". I am looking for a reference that doesn't actually assume much number-theoretic background.</p>

<p>My own background is in complex algebraic geometry.  I would like to have a reference that would be readable to someone who is comfortable with portions of either Griffiths-Harris or Hartshorne and with basic representation theory, but who may not have had much prior exposure to algebraic number theory.</p>

<p>Any advice would be appreciated it.</p>
