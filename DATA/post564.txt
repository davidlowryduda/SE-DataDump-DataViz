<p>I have found the book <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/082183259X" rel="nofollow">Local Fields and Their Extensions</a> which seems to correspond to the start of serre's book with many exercises. There is also the online <a href="http://websites.math.leidenuniv.nl/algebra/localfields.pdf" rel="nofollow">notes</a> by Stevenhagen, which have a lot of exercises.</p>
