## Body:
<p>People often recommend Grothendieck's EGA (Elements de Geometrie Algebrique) and SGA (seminaire de geometrie algebrique) as a good reference for learning arithmetic geometry. However, as the title suggests, these books are in french. Does anyone know if there is a translation available for them?</p>
