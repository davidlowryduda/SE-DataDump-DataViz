<p>Prove that the ideal in $\mathbb{Q}$ generated by $N_{k/\mathbb{Q}} (\alpha)$ is the absolute norm of the ideal $(\alpha)$ in $R_k$.  If $k$ is Galois over $\mathbb{Q}$, this can be done cleanly and simply.  Prove that the product of the conjugates of a prime power $\mathfrak{p}^k$ in $R_k$ is principal, generated by the rational integer $\left| R_k/\mathfrak{p}^k \right|$.  Then show that this result extends (by the Chinese Remainder theorem and the Unique Factorization Theorem for ideals in $R_k$) to arbitrary nonzero ideals of $R_k$.</p>

<p>I would imagine the mess you saw in your reading is due to the fact that multiplying the conjugates of a prime ideal doesn't make any sense if the field is not Galois, so a lot of complication is added dealing with the more general case.</p>
