<p>I would just start by looking at Marcus' Number Fields for the basic algebraic number theory. It also contains tons of exercises. If you read the first 4 chapters, you should have the necessary background for most of Washington's book. I'm not familiar with Lang.</p>

<p>I started studying algebraic number theory last summer by going through Marcus book.</p>
