<p>Taking logs, one finds that $2^a 3^b \leq N$ if and only if 
$a \log 2 + b \log 3 \leq \log N.$
So estimating the number of 3-smooth integers $\leq N$ is the same as estimating
the number of integer lattice points in the region
$a, b \geq 0, a \log 2 + b \log 3 \leq \log N.$
The standard estimate for the number of integer lattice points in a convex region is the area of the region.  In our case the region is a triangle, of area equal to
$$\dfrac{1}{2}\dfrac{\log N}{\log 2}\dfrac{\log N}{\log 3},$$
which is close to the estimate you attribute to Ramanujan.</p>

<p>More precisely, the estimate you wrote down is equal 
to $$\dfrac{1}{2}\dfrac{\log N + \log 2}{\log 2}\dfrac{\log N + \log 3}{\log 3}
= \dfrac{1}{2}\left(\dfrac{\log N}{\log 2} + 1\right)\left(\dfrac{\log N}{\log 3} + 1\right).$$
This probably improves the estimate coming from the area, by including correction terms coming from the integer points along the boundary of the region (in particular, the contributions coming from $a = 0$ or $b = 0$).</p>

<p>(The fact that these "boundary" contributions come with a multiplicity of $1/2$ seems similar to other contexts in which one approximates a discrete sum by an area, e.g. in Euler--MacLaurin summation, and perhaps thinking from that point of view would let one get a better handle on the precise estimates.)</p>
