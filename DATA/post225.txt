## Body:
<p>I have done a short course (one semester) on algebraic number theory at beginning graduate level, in which the Dedekind theory of ideals features prominently. However I have since discovered that there was an alternative approach put forward by Kronecker featuring 'divisors' which seems not to be used.</p>

<p>My question is, is there a good book for beginners or other reference that I could use to find out more about this? All the textbooks on algebraic number theory I have seen use ideals, certainly in my college library. Thank you</p>
