<p>Last year, in a talk of Michel Waldschmidt's, I remember hearing a statement along the lines of the title of this question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Galois group of $\pi$ is $\mathbb{Z}$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In what sense/framework is this true? What was meant exactly - and can this notion be made precise?</p>

<p>I imagine that this would draw on the fact that the $\sin x$ is an 'infinite polynomial' over $\mathbb{Q}$ whose roots are the integer multiples of $\pi$. However, if this is the case, then how can we possibly view this function as a sort of generalized 'minimal polynomial' while we have factorizations like $\sin x = 2 \cos (x/2) \cdot \sin (x/2)$?</p>
