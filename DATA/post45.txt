<p>The greedy solution is not optimal in general, even for the case when the value of any coin is bigger than the sum of all coins of lower denomination.  For example, suppose we have coins of denominations 25, 9, 4, and 1.  For 37 cents, the greedy solution uses five coins: one 25, one 9, and three 1s.  However, the optimal solution is four coins: one 25 and three 4s.</p>

<p>The problem of finding the minimum number of coins given a set of denominations is called the <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change-making_problem">change-making problem</a></em>.  It's a variant of the famous knapsack problem and is known to be difficult in the general case.</p>

<p>An integer-programming formulation for the change-making problem was given in the answer to this math.SE question:  <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/21949/on-problems-of-coins-totaling-to-a-given-amount">On problems of coins totaling to a given amount</a>.  </p>

<p><em>Added</em>: While the Wikipedia article on the change-making problem claims that the greedy algorithm is optimal for U.S. coins, it provides no proof.  The article "<a href="http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/0809/0809.0400v1.pdf">Canonical Coin Systems for Change-Making Problems</a>" discusses characterizations for when the greedy algorithm is optimal for coin systems of up to five denominations.  It also implies that for systems of larger than five denominations determining when the greedy algorithm is optimal is still an open problem.</p>
