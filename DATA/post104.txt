## Body:
<p>I did a search and found the <a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/gkp.html" rel="nofollow">1994-1997 errata</a> for the book.</p>

<p>So, the question was changed to:</p>

<pre><code>Let R(N) be the number of pairs of (m,n) such that 1≤m≤N, 1≤n≤N, and m⊥n
</code></pre>

<p>This also slightly changes the solution for R(N), and everything makes sense. I don't post the solution to prevent spoilers.</p>

<p>I'm sorry for having wasted everybody's time.</p>
