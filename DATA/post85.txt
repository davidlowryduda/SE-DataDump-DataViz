<p>As Qiaochu points out, while the Carmichael function indicates how much the multiplicative group fails to be cyclic (when it is less than Euler's totient function), the characterization of those $n &gt; 1$ for which the multiplicative group of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ is cyclic was done first.</p>

<p>The result is given in Gauss's Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, articles 52-56 and 82-89, although that precedes the terminology of groups and is thus framed in terms of congruence classes of integers and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_root_modulo_n" rel="nofollow">primitive roots modulo n</a>: "In Article 56 [Gauss] states that Lambert and Euler knew of them, but that his is the first rigorous demonstration that they exist."  The Wikipedia article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_group_of_integers_modulo_n" rel="nofollow">Multiplicative group of integers modulo n</a> gives a sketch of a modern proof using the prime powers factorization of n and the corresponding factorization of the group of units.</p>

<p>Once it has been worked out which prime powers n have cyclic multiplicative groups, the crux of the proof is that a product of two cyclic groups is cyclic if and only if their orders are coprime.</p>
