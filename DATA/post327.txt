<p>Even assuming undergraduate real analysis I think John Derbyshire's <em>Prime Obsession</em> is worth a look, and then, for its treatment of the Prime Number Theorem and generalizations, G.J.O. Jameson's <em>The Prime Number Theorem</em>. I recommend these as a non-expert who found them accessible but not patronizing. </p>
