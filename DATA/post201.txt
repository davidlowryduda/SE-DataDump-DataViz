<p>Thanks a lot Prof.Matthew Emerton for taking interest in answering.</p>

<p>I never know that there is such theorem but I understood it the other manner, we know that 
 $$ c_p = \begin{cases} 2 &amp; \text{ if } p \mid \Delta, \\ 1 &amp; \text{otherwise}. \end{cases}. $$</p>

<p>So if we consider $\prod c_p$ it would be $2*2*2*......$ r times ( since we take $p \mid \Delta$= $2^r$ ) , so it follows that $$\prod c_p = 2^r.$$
 So we have $[Cl^+(k):Cl^+(k)^2] = 2^{r-1}$ so that probably $\prod c_p = 2[Cl^+(k):Cl^+(k)^2] $ , I was looking for that answer but as nobody answered it and as you remarked that you are a bit busy now and cutting of your participation further, I dont wanted to disturb you again sir.
Your references were very useful and thanks a lot again sir !! . I think its the same version you posted here.</p>
