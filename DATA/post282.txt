## Body:
<p>I was wondering if anyone is aware of any existing literature on the arithmetic function defined as $$f(n):=2^{\omega(n)}\tau(n).$$ Here $\omega(n)$ is the number of distinct prime divisors of $n$ and $\tau(n)$ is the number of divisors of $n$. In particular, I am interested in the behavior of $$\sum_{d \mid n}f(d)$$ </p>
