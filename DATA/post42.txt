<p>The aim of the question is very simple, I would like to study Artin-Schreier Theory, but I have had embarassing difficulties in finding a book which could help me in doing that.</p>

<p>In specific I'm looking for a book which write down explicitely the main theorem of Artin-Schreir Theory, and have also a proof of it (or at least a sketch of it) and maybe also a short introduction on the topic.</p>

<p>The closest I get in the matter is with the book "Cohomology of Number Fields" of Neukirch, which is suggested as a reference by the Wikipedia page on Artin-Schreier Theory. But it doesn't fit with the requests I made above.</p>

<p>So the question is, what is the name of such a book? Or, if such abook does not exist, do you have any suggestions on how to proceed?</p>

<p>Thank you very much!</p>
