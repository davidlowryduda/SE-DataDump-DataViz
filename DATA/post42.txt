<p>I am interested in algebraic number theory and I am recently acquainted with the theory of valuations, which further leads to Riemann-Roch theory, and which is closely related to algebraic geometry, and the algebraic-K-theory.<br>
Therefore, my problem is:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are there excellent introductory books of the theory of Algebraic Geometry to recommend?  </p>

<p>Since I know in general nothing about this theory, I may want a book which explains the ideas as clear as possible and which at the mean time contains as much material as possible.<br>
If I am asking too much, then any good book in your view suffices.<br>
Thanks very much.</p>
