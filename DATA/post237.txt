<p>For any rational number $x$, there exists an elliptic curve $E$ over $\mathbf{Q}$ without any rational points whose $j$-invariant is $x$. </p>

<p>I can't give you the precise details at the moment, but the idea is that you can twist your elliptic curve and get rid of any rational point.</p>

<p>I can't give you any equations either. </p>

<p>At least we know there exists such a family now.</p>
