<p>Speaking completely from personal experience, I learned almost everything I know in terms of asymptotics and bounding integrals from doing analytic number theory problems.  (For the 1-2 from UBC, it was those Math 539 problem sets!)</p>

<p>These specific types of manipulations didn't actually come up in any of my analysis courses over the years.  However, knowing basic analysis and how to work with limits <em>is very important,</em> and is a definite prerequisite.  Rudin's "Principles of Mathematical Analysis 3E" is the standard text for an introduction to analysis.  Understanding the basics in the first 1-7 chapters and having some basic complex analysis is fundamental.</p>

<p>If you are already familiar with these concepts, then I suggest working through the proofs and the exercises in your analytic number theory book. </p>

<p><strong>Remark:</strong>  Both of the books you mention are excellent, but I would not usually recommended them if you have never seen analytic number theory before.</p>

<p>I personally used Montgomery and Vaughn's book, which I quite like, but I have heard very good things about Davenport's Multiplicative Number Theory.  <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/29056/supplemental-number-theory-text-to-montgomery-and-vaughan">This Math Stack Exchange question</a> deals with books for analytic number theory.</p>
