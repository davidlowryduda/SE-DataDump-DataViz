## Body:
<p>The arXiv blog having chosen GrossOne for <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/arxiv/27656">its daily pick of today</a>, I read the arXiv paper concerned, and posted a comment there. The arXiv blog used to be quite high profile as these things go.</p>

<p>Is there an existing well-known (but not to me) mathematical construction that does what Sergeyev proposes?</p>
