$This notion is called <em>asymptotic density</em> or <em>natural density</em>.
If you are using limsup and liminf, it is upper and lower asymptotic density, see e.g.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptotic_density" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>Let me start by mentioning some properties of asymptotic density, which I consider useful. Of course any such list is necessarily incomplete, and the choice is matter of opinion. Then I will give several references and I will mention which of these results are contained there.</p>

<p>I will not speak about Szemerédi's theorem - perhaps someone who knows more about this topic will suggest suitable references.</p>

<h3>Basic properties</h3>

<p>The following results are obtained easily from the definition and properties of limit inferior and limit superior.</p>

<p>$0\leq \ul d(A) \leq \ol d(A) \leq 1$<br>
If $A\subseteq B\subseteq\N$, then $\ul d(A)\leq \ul d(B)$ and $\ol d(A)\leq \ol d(B)$.<br>
If $A,B\subseteq\N$, $A\cap B=\emps$, then
$$\ul d(A)+\ul d(B) \leq \ul d(A\cup B) \leq \ul d(A)+\ol d(B) \leq \ol d(A\cup B) \leq \ol d(A)+\ol d(B).$$
Consequently, the asymptotic density is finitely additive.<br>
$\ol d(\N\sm A)=1-\ul d(A)$, $\ul d(\N\sm A)=1-\ol d(A)$
For any $a\in\langle0,1\rangle$ there is a set $A\subseteq\N$ such that $d(A)=a$.</p>

<h3>Alternative definitions</h3>

<p>As you already mentioned, the asymptotic density is defined by $\underline d(A):=\liminf_{n\to\infty} \frac{A(n)}n$, $\overline d(A):=\liminf_{n\to\infty} \frac{A(n)}n$ and $d(A):=\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{A(n)}n$, where $A(n):=\abs{A\cap\{1,2,\ldots,n\}}$.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is useful to know, that there are different expressions. The first one is about a set given by an increasing sequence of positive integers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Proposition 1.</strong> If $A=\{a_1&lt;a_2&lt;\ldots&lt;a_k&lt;\ldots\}\subseteq\N$, then
  $$
\begin{gather*}
\ul d(A)=\liminf_{k\to\infty} \frac k{a_k}\\
\ol d(A)=\limsup_{k\to\infty} \frac k{a_k}\\
d(A)=\lim_{k\to\infty} k \frac k{a_k}
\end{gather*}
$$</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sometimes it is useful to be able to compute densities of set consisting of intervals. For example, this is useful when constructing an example of a set which does not have asymptotic density, i.e., a set $A$ such that $\ul d(A) &lt; \ol d(A)$.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Proposition 2.</strong>
  Let $a_n$, $b_n$ be increasing sequences of positive integers such that
  $a_n&lt;b_n&lt;a_{n+1}$ for each $n\in\N$. Then for the set
  $A=\N\cap\bigcup\limits_{n=1}^\infty (a_n,b_n\rangle$ we have
  \begin{gather*}
\ol d(A):=\limsup_{n\to\infty} \frac{A(b_n)}{b_n}\\
\ul d(A):=\liminf_{n\to\infty} \frac{A(a_n)}{a_n}
\end{gather*}</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, both these results are relatively easy to show.</p>

<h3>Density of some special sets</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem 3.</strong> If $A=\{a_1&lt;a_2&lt;\ldots&lt;a_n&lt;\ldots\}\subseteq\N$ and the series
  $\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac 1{a_k}$ converges, then the set $A$ has
  asymptotic density and $d(A)=0$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A proof of this result can be found at this site, see <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/5932/theorem-on-natural-density">this question</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem 4.</strong> Let $\mathbb P$ denote the set of all prime numbers. Then $d(\mathbb P)=0$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A very nice proof of can be found in Pete L. Clark's and robjohn's answers <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/82074/percentage-of-primes-among-the-natural-numbers">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Comparison with other densities</h3>

<p>Some other densities are often studied in number theory. I will mention two of them: logarithmic density and Banach density (also called uniform density).</p>

<p>Let us denote $S(n):=\sum\limits_{k=1}^n \frac 1k$ for any $n\in\N$.
Let $A\subseteq\N$. Then the values
$$\ul \delta(A)=\liminf_{n\to\infty} \frac{\sum\limits_{k\in A; k\leq n} \frac 1k}{S(n)} \qquad \ol \delta(A) = \limsup_{n\to\infty}
\frac{\sum\limits_{k\in A; k\leq n} \frac 1k}{S(n)}$$ are called
<em>upper</em> and <em>lower logarithmic density</em> of the set
$A$. If $\ol\delta(A)=\ul\delta(A)$, then this value is denoted
by $\delta(A)$ and called the <em>logarithmic density</em> of the set $A$.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem 5.</strong>  For any subset $A\subseteq\N$ the inequality
  $$\ul d(A) \leq \ul \delta (A) \leq \ol \delta(A) \leq \ol d(A)$$
  holds. Consequently, if a set has asymptotic density, it also has logarithmic density.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See e.g. the proof at <a href="http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/InequalityOfLogarithmicAndAsymptoticDensity.html" rel="nofollow">Planetmath</a>.</p>

<p><em>Banach (uniform) density</em> is defined as follows:
$$\overline u(A)=\lim_{s\to\infty} \max_{t\ge 0}\frac{A(t+1,t+s)}{s}$$
$$\underline u(A)=\lim_{s\to\infty} \min_{t\ge 0}\frac{A(t+1,t+s)}{s}$$
where $A(m,k)=|A\cap\{m,m+1,\dots,k\}|$.</p>

<p>If these values are the same, them $u(A)=\ol u(A)=\ul u(A)$.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem 6.</strong> The inequalities $$\underline u(A)\le \underline d(A) \le \overline d(A) \le \overline u(A)$$ hold for every $A\subseteq\N$.
  (Consequently, every set that has uniform density also has asymptotic density.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The proof of these inequalities can be found e.g. in: Z. Gáliková, B. Lászlo and T. Šalát: <a href="http://www.emis.ams.org/journals/AMI/2002/acta2002-galikova-laszlo-salat.pdf" rel="nofollow">Remarks on uniform density of sets of integers</a>.</p>

<p>Note: Several equivalent definitions of Banach density appear in literature.</p>

<h3>Niven's result</h3>

<p>The following result is from the paper
Ivan Niven. <a href="http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.bams/1183516304" rel="nofollow">The asymptotic density of sequences</a>. Bull. Amer. Math. Soc., 57(6):420-434, 1951. Often it can be used to show that asymptotic density of some set is $0$.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem 7.</strong> If for a set of primes $\{p_i\}$ we have $d(A_{p_i})=0$ for every $i$, and if $\sum p_i^{-1}=\infty$ then $d(A)=0$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here, for any $A\subseteq\mathbb N$ and a prime $p$, the set $A_p$ is defined as
$$A_p=\{n\in A; p\mid n, p^2\nmid n\}.$$</p>

<p>Note: If we defined $A_p=\{n\in A; p\mid n\}$ instead of the above result, we would get a weaker result, but the proof is much simpler.</p>
