## Body:
<p>For a function $f$, it is known that $|f|_{U_2} \le |f|_{U_3} \le |f|_{U_4} \le\dots$</p>

<p>Is there an example for a function $f$ such that $|f|_{U_3} &lt; |f|_{U_4}$ (i.e. they are not equal?). The bigger the gap between them, the better.</p>

<p>I think there is a known construction of Gowers doing it but have no reference.</p>
