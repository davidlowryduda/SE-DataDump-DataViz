## Body:
<p>By Hermite's theorem, there are only finitely many number fields of bounded (equivalently, fixed) discriminant. But I assume that people have collected data about this to say more than just that? </p>

<p>I tried looking around and found several tables about related results but never about this particular one. Thank you in advance for any help!</p>
