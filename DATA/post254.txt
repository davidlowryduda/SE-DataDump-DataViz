<p>Another more recent book (1998) is Smart's <a href="http://books.google.fr/books?id=faYE_41prOkC&amp;pg=PR11" rel="nofollow">"The Algorithmic Resolution of Diophantine Equations"</a>. </p>

<p>From the preface : "Despite the long and noble career of diophantine equations, there appear to be only two books solely devoted to the study of explicit methods for their solution, namely Mordell's <em>Diophantine Equations</em> and de Weger's <em>Algorithms For Diophantine Equations</em>..." (de Weger's book adds the use of LLL-algorithm to solve diophantine equations).</p>
