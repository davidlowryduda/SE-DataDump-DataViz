## Body:
<p>If $p\equiv 1\pmod{3}$, it's well know that $p$ can be expressed as
$$
p=\frac{1}{4}(L^2+27M^2).
$$
A handful of places, like wikipedia, say that in this representation $L$ and $M$ are unique up to sign, but none actually has a proof.</p>

<p>Is there a elementary proof that $L$ and $M$ are unique up to sign? Thanks.</p>
