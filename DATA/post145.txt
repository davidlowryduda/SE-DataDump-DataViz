<p>Well, from what I can tell, three main witty things are done with congruences in number theory here: we use Fermat's Little Theorem and Euler's Theorem, devise divisibility rules, or combine them with the Chinese Remainder Theorem. I suppose we might also use Quadratic Reciprocity upon occasion (I think it's particularly important). I don't really think of many other things than these that we use, in general,</p>

<p>All of these, and the more fundamental properties of congruences, should be handled in most Elementary Number Theory books. I happen to know that Rosen's Intro to Elementary Number Theory has all of these in it. I also love that book.</p>
