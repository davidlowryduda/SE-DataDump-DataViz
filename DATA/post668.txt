<p>If you want to study number theory from a solid foundation, I would recommend:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Elementary-Number-Theory-David-Burton/dp/0071289194" rel="nofollow">Elementary Number Theory</a>, by David Burton.</p>

<p>It has been used at undergraduate level by universities successfully, and at least the earlier chapters should be well within the ability of a bright school student.</p>
