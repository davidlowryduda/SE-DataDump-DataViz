<p>There are several elementary number theory books which you could use and which do not assume a level of knowledge beyond high school math. I would strongly recommend Underwood Dudley's Elementary Number Theory and Harold Stark's An Introduction to Number Theory. </p>

<p>They're both beautifully written and cover most of the things that are usually covered in any introductory number theory course (at a basic level of course). Some of the other books that have already been suggested are excelent. </p>

<p>Particularly Katie Banks' suggestion of Ireland and Rosen, although this book makes some use of the language of groups, rings and fields, so it may be more advanced for a high school student.</p>
