<p>If $F$ is a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ then its of integers $R$ is a Dedekind domain, and has unique factorization of ideals into powers of prime ideals. For each prime number $\ell$, you can then look at how $\ell R$ decomposes and the prime factors of this ideal are exactly the primes of $\mathfrak{q}\subset R$ such that $\mathfrak{q}\cap \mathbb{Z} = (\ell)$. If $F$ is Galois over $\mathbb{Q}$, then $Gal(F/\mathbb{Q})$ acts transitively on the set of prime ideals lying over $\ell$. </p>

<p>What's the situation if we look at the ring $R'$ of all algebraic integers in $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$? I read somewhere else that $R'$ is a non-noetherian domain of krull dimension $1$ and it is integrally closed, so it is missing noetherianity.</p>

<p>I mean to ask, </p>

<ol>
<li>If $\ell$ is a rational prime, are there only finitely many prime ideals of $R'$ lying over $\ell$?</li>
<li>Does $Gal(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q})$ act transitively on the set of such primes?</li>
</ol>

<p>Better yet, it would be nice to know about a reference for these things.</p>
