Closed-form Expression of the Partition Function $p(n)$

## Body:
<p>I feel like I have seen news that a paper was recently published, at most a few months ago, that solved the well-known problem of finding a closed-form expression for the partition function $p(n)$ which enumerates the number of integer partitions of $n$: does anybody have the reference of this paper?</p>

<p>And if not a closed-form exactly, then I seem to recall some significant advance was made recently: can you provide any bibliography (2010, 2011)?</p>

<p>Hopefully this will ring a bell with someone...</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
