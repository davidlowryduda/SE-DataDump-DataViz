<p>For any reference requirement related to Ramanujan, it is always a good idea to check the series of volumes, titled Ramanujan's notebooks, compiled and annotated by Bruce C. Berndt and others.</p>

<p>This is a special case of Entry 15 in Ramanujan's second notebook, which is about numbers of the form $\displaystyle a^p b^q$.</p>

<p>A reference to this can be found here: <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=tX5UUCempn8C&amp;pg=PA66" rel="nofollow">Ramanujan's notebooks, Volume 4</a>.</p>

<p>(I suggest you read page 66 onwards)</p>

<p>A snapshot (from the google books link itself):</p>

<p>This volume talks about the "proof" Ramanujan gave (pages 68 and 69), provides references to Hardy's book (which apparently has a whole chapter on this) and also mentions a paper by Hardy and Littlewood which deals with it.</p>

<p>De Bruijn has considered the number of $y$-smooth numbers in this paper: <a href="http://alexandria.tue.nl/repository/freearticles/597499.pdf" rel="nofollow">On the number of positive integer less than x and free of prime factors greater than y</a>. </p>

<p>The number of $y$-smooth numbers $\le x$ is apparently now known in literature as the DeBruijn function: $\psi(x,y)$. </p>

<p>A closely related function is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dickman_function" rel="nofollow">DeBruijn-Dickman</a> function.</p>

<p>There is also a <a href="http://archive.numdam.org/ARCHIVE/JTNB/JTNB_1993__5_2/JTNB_1993__5_2_411_0/JTNB_1993__5_2_411_0.pdf" rel="nofollow">survey</a> by Hildebrand and Tenenbaum which should be helpful.</p>
