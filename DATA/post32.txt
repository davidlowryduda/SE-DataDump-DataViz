## Body:
<p>It is easy to find 3 squares (of integers) in arithmetic progression. For example, $1^2,5^2,7^2$.</p>

<p>I've been told Fermat proved that there are no progressions of length 4 in the squares. Do you know of a proof of this result? </p>

<p>(Additionally, are there similar results for cubes, 4th powers, etc? If so, what would be a good reference for this type of material?)</p>
