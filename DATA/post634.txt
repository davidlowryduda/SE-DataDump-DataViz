<p>I have once heard a professor telling (during a course on Fourier theory) that there is a way to determine the numbers starting with a $2$ in the sequence $\{2^n\colon n\in\mathbb{N}\}$. I asked him about it, but he could not remember how. The proof involved the theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equidistributed_mod_1">equidistributed sequences</a> the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weyl%27s_criterion">Weyl criterion</a>.</p>

<p>Is there someone who knows how to prove this? Or is there a nice reference (preferably a book)?</p>
