<p>I will provide, for anyone who subsequently comes across this question, what I am finding most beneficial.</p>

<p>These are pieces most generously posted by Keith Conrad:</p>

<p>What makes them especially remarkable for me as a self-studier is the clarity of presentation, the richness of examples, and the frequent warnings that point out possible misconceptions. Plus the exposition is quite motivating and keeps you engrossed.</p>

<p>They cover a wide range of topics (I am focusing on the Algebraic Number Theory section). </p>

<p>RECENT EDIT</p>

<p>I just came across a great set of notes by Franz Lemmermeyer:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fen.bilkent.edu.tr/~franz/ant06/ant.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.fen.bilkent.edu.tr/~franz/ant06/ant.pdf</a></p>

<p>They a beautifully written and motivating, including numerous comments on the historical background involved in the development of the material.</p>

<p>REMARK ON ACCEPTING MY OWN ANSWER:</p>

<p>I appreciate the helpful advice offered, and have looked into them. However, I feel the items I've posted are of great value to me, so I wanted to emphasize that sentiment.</p>
