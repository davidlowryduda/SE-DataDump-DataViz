<p>A conjecture by Goldfeld says that half of all elliptic curves have rank zero (i.e. their Mordell-Weil group has finite order.)</p>

<p>Are there any known infinite families of elliptic curves (over $\mathbb{Q}$) with only finitely many rational points?</p>

<p>For example, in Silverman/Tate, there is an computation which shows that $y^2=x^3+x$ has exactly one rational point and $y^2=x^3+4x$ has exactly three rational points (not counting the point at infinity). I'm wondering if there are any known parameterizations giving an infinite number of such curves.</p>
