<p>When I was an undergrad, I was trying to learn this material for the purpose of finite geometry. I found that even with little background in Abstract Algebra, that <a href="http://www-ma4.upc.es/~simeon/IFG.pdf" rel="nofollow">this book</a> by Simeon Ball and Zsuzsa Weiner, was very readable. The beginning in particular focuses on what you asked about.</p>

<p>Not to mention, it's free!</p>
