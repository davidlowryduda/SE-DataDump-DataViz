## Body:
<p>an interesting book <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0883853159" rel="nofollow">Old and new unsolved problems in plane geometry and number theory</a> by Klee/Wagon (1991) includes the Collatz conjecture. on p225 they consider iterates $\mod 2^n$ and state that unless $n$ is congruent modulo 256 to 27, 31, 47, 63, 71, 91, 103, 111, 127, 155, 159, 167, 191, 207, 223, 231, 239, 251, 255 then the stopping time is less than 5 ("exercise 4"). (this seems to be a typo in that exercise 4 is not related to that fact. there is no further analysis other than the simple factoid.)</p>

<p>they point out this approach is useful as a sort of sieving approach to eliminate terminating trajectories and works for arbitrary values $\mod 2^n$.</p>
