<p>There is an article of Birch from 1969, titled <em>Weber's class invariants</em>, in which he proves, using basic class field theory and CM theory, various facts originally due to Weber, but whose proof was in doubt.  These are facts that Heegner cited in his proof, and Birch observes that one reason Heegner's proof was doubted.   Given this, it seems that Birch's article will be a useful companion when reading Heegner's argument.  </p>
