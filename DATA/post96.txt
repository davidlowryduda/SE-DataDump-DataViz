<p>Is there a book, website or something else aiming to catalogue all or many of the Diophantine equations that have already been solved?</p>

<p>I have two tiny books by Sierpi≈Ñski in which he gives some of those, but I suspect lots of kinds of equations must have been solved. (Although I really don't have much of an idea how many.) I would like to see such a catalogue to get an idea of what has been done.</p>
