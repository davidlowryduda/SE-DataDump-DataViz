## Body:
<p>In <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/318193/3-primes-conjecture">this excellent question</a> it occurred to me that there is a subtractive Goldbach problem: Every even integer may be written as $p-q$ for primes $p,q$.</p>

<p>Does anyone have a reference for this problem?</p>
