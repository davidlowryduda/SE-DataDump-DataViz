<p>As I mentioned at another post <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/13575/teaching-myself-differential-topology-and-differential-geometry/22583#22583">Teaching myself differential topology and differential geometry.</a></p>

<p>If you are interested in learning Algebraic Geometry I recommend the books of my Amazon list. They are in recommended order to learn from the beginning by yourself:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/lm/RHQS8Y3V7LJRQ/ref=cm_pdp_lm_title_1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/lm/RHQS8Y3V7LJRQ/ref=cm_pdp_lm_title_1</a></p>

<p>In particular, from that list, a quick path to understand basic Algebraic Geometry would be to read <strong>Bertrametti et al</strong>. <em>"Lectures on Curves, Surfaces and Projective Varieties"</em>, <strong>Shafarevich</strong>'s "<em>Basic Algebraic Geometry"</em> vol. 1, 2 and <strong>Perrin</strong>'s <em>"Algebraic Geometry an Introduction"</em>. But then you are entering the world of abstract algebra.</p>

<p>There is no a single complete book and much less explaining the ideas as clearly as possible. If you are starting from the very beginnig, I recommend these in this order: Karen <strong>Smith's, Beltrametti, Hulek, Safarechiv vol. 1, Perrin, Shafarevich vol. 2</strong> and then scheme theory with <strong>Ueno</strong>'s three volumes.... then you can jump with enough background to the bible by <strong>Hartshorne</strong>, or <strong>Griffiths/Harris</strong> for the more complex geometric side. </p>
