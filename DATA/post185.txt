## Body:
<p>I want to read particularly about diophantine Analysis and Elementary Number Theory from a novice level.</p>

<p>The books which I found on net:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A Guide to Elementary Number Theory by Underwood Dudley</p></li>
<li><p>Diophantine Analysis by Robert Daniel Carmichael</p></li>
<li><p>Diophantine Analysis by Jorn Steuding</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Help me with good suggestions as I think M.SE. has people from novice to professional users.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>P.S. I have searched M.SE. for this type of question, I didn't find any. If you know someone, you may give the link.</p>
