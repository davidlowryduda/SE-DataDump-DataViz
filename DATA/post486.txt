<ol>
<li>John Stillwell, <em>Elements of Number Theory</em> (Springer 2002). This is by a masterly expositor, and is particularly approachable.</li>
<li>G.H. Hardy and E.M. Wright, <em>An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers</em> (OUP 1938, and still going strong with a 6th edition in 2008). Also aimed at beginning undergraduate mathematicians and pleasingly accessible.</li>
<li>Alan Baker, <em>A Comprehensive Course in Number Theory</em> (CUP 2012) is a nice recent textbook (and a lot shorter than its title would suggest, too).</li>
