## Body:
<p>The number of primes in each of the $\phi(n)$ residue classes relatively prime to $n$ are known to occur with asymptotically equal frequency (following from the proof of the Prime Number Theorem). Does the same result hold on pairs of consecutive primes on the $\phi(n)^2$ pairs of congruence classes?</p>

<p>To wit: Consider $\{(2, 3), (3, 5), (5, 7), (7, 11), \ldots\}\pmod n$. Does $(a,b)$ occur with natural density
$$\begin{cases}
1/\phi(n)^2,&amp;\gcd(ab,n)=1\\
0,&amp;\text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$
