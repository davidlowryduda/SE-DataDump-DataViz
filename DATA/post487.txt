<p>I want to use Dirichlets theorem on primes for my diploma thesis. I want to use following form</p>

<p>Let $a,b\in\mathbb{N}$, such that $\gcd(a,b)=1$. Then the set $\{a\cdot n+b| n\in\mathbb{N}\}$ contains infinitely prime numbers.</p>

<p>Does anyone knows a good book as reference?</p>

<p>Thanks for help.</p>
