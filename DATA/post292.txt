<p>For the first claim: The subset of the finite ideles given by $\prod_v \mathcal{O}_{K_v}^\times$ is open by the definition of the topology on the restricted direct product, and an element in $K^\times$ is in this subset iff it is a unit in each completion, which is true iff it's in $\mathcal{O}^\times$.</p>

<p>The second claim is just a generalization of this first argument. A basis of open neighborhoods of 1 in the finite ideles is given by picking any open subgroup you choose of $K_v^\times$ in finitely many of the $v$-spots and picking $\mathcal{O}_v^\times$ in all the rest of them. If we just want a basis of open subsets, we may as well only look at really small ones, so we can assume that in the finitely many $v$-spots where we didn't pick $\mathcal{O}_v^\times$, we picked some small open subset of $\mathcal{O}_v^\times$. Note that subgroups of $\mathcal{O}_v^\times$ are all finite index and generated by a power of the uniformizer. Note also that all these open subsets of the ideles are subsets of the one we discussed in checking the first claim.</p>

<p>What happens when we intersect such a neighborhood with the diagonal image of $K^\times$? We get the subgroup of elements in $\mathcal{O}_K^\times$ which are in all the open subgroups of $\mathcal{O}_v^\times$ that we picked at the special places $v$. The index is just the product of the indices of those subgroups, so that's a finite index subgroup. Conversely, any finite index subgroup of $\mathcal{O}_K^\times$ is determined by the index of its image in each completion.</p>
