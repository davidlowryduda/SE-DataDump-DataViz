<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_group" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is known that $(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^\times$ is cyclic if and only if n is 1 or 2 or 4 or $p^k$ or $2p^k$ for an odd prime number p and k â‰¥ 1.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The statement seems provable given the definition and properties of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmichael_function" rel="nofollow">Carmichael function</a>.</p>

<p>I need a reference (preferably a book) to read more on cyclic group, their order, and the Carmichael function. I tried several book (on number theory or algebra), but I couldn't find one that stated and proved the above theorem.</p>

<p>Could you please recommend one?</p>
