<p>Since you never bothered to specify your personal background, I'll take the liberty that you are familiar with category theory. In which case, one can construct the $p$-adic numbers by taking an appropriate inverse limit. <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/38517/in-relatively-simple-words-what-is-an-inverse-limit/38522#38522">This MathSE post by Arturo</a> would, for (the hypothetical) you (who is familiar with category theory) then, give a good introduction to what $p$-adic numbers are. See also the book reference Arturo gave there. </p>
