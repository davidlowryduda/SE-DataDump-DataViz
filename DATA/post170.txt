<p>Dirichlet arithmetic progression theorem, or more generally, Chabotarev density theorem, has applications to algebraic number theory, especially in class-field theory.<br>
Since we might think of the density theorem as an analytic theorem, and as prime number theorem is one main theorem of analytic number theory, one is led to wonder:  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>if there is any application of prime number theorem to algebraic number theory.  </p>

<p>Thanks for any attention in advance.   </p>
