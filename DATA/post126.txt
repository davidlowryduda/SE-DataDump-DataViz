<p>Having been inspired by <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/160983/famous-papers-in-algebraic-geometry/160985#160985">this question</a> I was wondering, what are some important papers in arithmetic geometry and number theory that should be read by students interested in these fields?</p>

<p>There is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_important_publications_in_mathematics#Number_theory" rel="nofollow">related wikipedia article</a> along these lines, but it doesn't mention some important papers such as Mazur's "Modular Curves and the Eisenstein ideal" paper or Ribet's Inventiones 100 paper.</p>
