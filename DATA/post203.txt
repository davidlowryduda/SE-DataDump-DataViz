<p>There are several problems here</p>

<ul>
<li>The difference between an odd prime $p$ and 2 is not an even number</li>
<li>If $n$ and $k$ have the same parity and $n&gt;k+2$ then neither $n+k$ nor $n-k$ are prime</li>
<li>You cannot talk about the probability of finding primes in this sense: a given number is either prime or not.  You might turn it into a probabilistic statement if you had a meaningful way of choosing $n$ and $k$ with some kind of distribution.  Or you could take the route of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bateman%E2%80%93Horn_conjecture" rel="nofollow">Bateman-Horn conjecture</a></li>
</ul>
