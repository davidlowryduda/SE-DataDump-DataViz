<p>The blurb for Cohen's <a href="http://books.google.ca/books/about/Number_Theory_Analytic_and_modern_tools.html?id=HSCWL8SfJPQC&amp;redir_esc=y" rel="nofollow">two volume set on Number Theory</a> says 
that "the central theme is the solution of Diophantine equations".
I haven't yet read these books in detail, so I'm not sure 
how helpful these they will be.   </p>
