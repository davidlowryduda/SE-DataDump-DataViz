<p>If we na√Øvely apply the formula $$\sum_0^\infty a^i = {1\over 1-a}$$ when $a=2$, we get the silly-seeming claim that $1+2+4+\ldots = -1$. But  in the 2-adic integers, this formula is correct. </p>

<p>Surely this is not a coincidence? What is the connection here?  Do the $p$-adics provide generally useful methods for summing divergent series?  I know very little about either divergent series or $p$-adic analysis; what is a good reference for either topic?</p>
