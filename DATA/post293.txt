## Body:
<p>Below is the plot $N_k(x)$, where $N_k(x)$ is the counting function of numbers with $k$ prime factors (counted with multiplicity), and $k=\lfloor\log_2(x)\rfloor-2$, which generates a repeating 'Devil's Staircase', (repeating every $2^n$, where $n\in\mathbb{N}$):</p>

<p>The oeis sequence A052130 alludes to the limits of such plots. I was wondering whether there was any other information out there on this? (Most studies on almost primes seems to be for fixed $k$.)</p>

<p>I also include a plot of the sequence mentioned above, each term divided by $2(e-\gamma)^n$:</p>

<p>&amp; two cycles of $N_k(x)$ (after limit of $84$ reached) for $k=\lfloor\log_2(x)\rfloor-6$ for comparison:</p>
