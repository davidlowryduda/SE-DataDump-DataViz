<p>A finite group $G$ of order $n$ is said to be realizable (over $\mathbb{Q}$) if there exists a Galois extension $L/\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\mathrm{Gal}(L/\mathbb{Q})=G$. I'm curious what classes of groups are known to be realizable?</p>

<p>Shafarevich proved that solvable groups are realizable. Thus the following results "nontrivially" imply realizability:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If $n$ is odd, $G$ is solvable.</p>
  
  <p>If $n$ has prime factorization $n=\prod p_i$, then $G$ is solvable.</p>
  
  <p>If $n$ is of the form $p^\alpha q^\beta$ where $p,q$ are prime and $\alpha,\beta \geq 0$, $G$ is solvable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is worthwhile to point out that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If $G_1,\ldots,G_m$ are solvable then so is $G_1 \times \cdots \times G_m$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What other classes are known to be realizable? I've googled on it but can't find a big list or whatever.</p>

<p>(The smallest group I've found through Groupprops not to be immediately identifiable as realizable is $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{F}_5)$.)</p>

<p>Edit: If no one objects I'll continuously update this question whenever I find something interesting.</p>
