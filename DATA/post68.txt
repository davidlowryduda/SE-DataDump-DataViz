<p>Guy, Unsolved Problems In Number Theory, 3rd edition, Problem D7: Sum of consecutive powers made a power. "Rufus Bowen conjectured that the equation $$1^n+2^n+\cdots+m^n=(m+1)^n$$ has no nontrivial solutions...." Guy gives a lot more info on what's known about the question, but doesn't give a reference for Bowen. The earliest reference he gives with the equation in the title is L Moser, On the diophantine equation $1^n+2^n+\cdots+(m-1)^n=m^n$, Scripta Math 19 (1953) 84-88, MR 14, 950. The only older reference he gives is P Erd≈ës, Advanced problem 4347, Amer Math Monthly 56 (1949) 343. I haven't looked at either one. </p>
