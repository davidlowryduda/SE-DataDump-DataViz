<p>There is a book called <em>$p$-adic Numbers</em> by Fernando Q. Gouvea which seems nice, as Mariano pointed out while I was typing. I'm not entirely sure that Mariano and Gouvea are different people, I have never seen them in a room together.</p>

<p>A rather different direction is from the tradition of quadratic forms. The setting for the Hasse-Minkowski principle is the $p$-adic numbers, then certain global relations, and so on. So, there are <em>The Arithmetic Theory of Quadratic Forms</em> by B. W. Jones, <em>Integral Quadratic Forms</em> by G. L. Watson, 
 <em>Rational Quadratic Forms</em> by Cassels, <em>The Sensual Quadratic Form</em> by J. H. Conway. </p>
