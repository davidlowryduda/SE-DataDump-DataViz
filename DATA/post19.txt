<p>The continued fraction expansion of any possible real number falls in one of 2 possible categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>the continued fraction expansion has a finite length if and only if the number is rational.</li>
<li>the continued fraction expansion never ends if and only if the number is irrational.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>"quite a few other mathematical constants are known to have an infinite continued fraction"</em></p>

<p>Yes, and all such constants are therefore all irrational.</p>

<p><em>"Catalan's Constant ... known to have an infinite continued fraction"</em></p>

<p>Do you have a proof? My understanding is that we don't yet know whether or not Catalan's Constant has an finite continued fraction -- therefore we don't yet know whether or not it is rational.</p>

<p>"Why does the degree of an need to be smaller than the degree of bn in order for a continued fraction representation of a constant to be irrational?"</p>

<p>That is required for the sequence to converge on some specific value.
If the degree of an is <em>larger</em>, that doesn't mean the result is rational -- it indicates that it doesn't converge to any real number, and therefore isn't a "constant" at all.</p>

<p>Is there a way to make the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_continued_fraction#Conditions_for_irrationality" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia "generalized continued fraction" article</a> a little less confusing?</p>
