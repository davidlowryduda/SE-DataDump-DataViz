## Body:
<p>I have seen that sometimes, in particular in number theory and combinatorial commutative algebra, our questions are somehow related to finding the number of points with integer components in a region/shape. Since this seems to be related to some open problems and conjectures, does there exist a branch of mathematics that specifically study such questions? If yes, what it's called and what prerequisites one must know to study it.</p>
