  <p>I haven't read the references the author cites, but I don't see a lot of merit in this paper. The final answers seems to be simply taking the formula for the area of the Sierpiniski carpet (respectively Menger sponge) after n steps replacing the symbol n by the GrossOne symbol.</p>
  
  <p>Note that this is not assigning an actual area to the Sierpinsiki
  carpet! If we defined the Sierpinski carpet by a different procedure,
  we would get a different answer. For example, if we lumped together
  every two steps, we would get the answer that the area of the
  Sierpinski carpet after GrossOne steps is (8/9)^{2*GrossOne}. The
  point of measure theory (which assigns the Sierpinski carpet measure
  0) or more generally Hausdorff measure (which tells us that the
  Sierpinski carpet has (log 8/log 3)-dimensional area equal to 1) is to
  assign areas to subsets of the plane no matter how they are defined.</p>
  
  <p>I also strongly disagree that mathematicians do not have good tools to
  describe behavior of functions close to infinity. For this sort of
  simple exponential decay, the ordinary language of asymptotic
  expansions does excellently. (See, for example, de Bruijn's Asymtotic
  Methods in Analysis.) For more complicated decay, the theory of
  transeries is excellent (see Edgar, Transseries for Beginners, Real
  Anal. Exchange 35 (2010), also available at
  <a href="http://www.math.osu.edu/~edgar.2/preprints/trans_begin/beginners.pdf">http://www.math.osu.edu/~edgar.2/preprints/trans_begin/beginners.pdf</a> )
  for a good introduction. And, for these sort of specific fractal
  examples, this is what Hausdorff dimension and Hausdorff measure were
  invented for! See any textbook on Fractal Geometry.</p>
  
  <p>I would not expect this paper to appear in a quality journal.</p>
  
  <p>I usually wouldn't write something like this in public. This is what
  I'd normally send to an editor who contacted me to referee something
  like this. (Also, I am not an expert on fractals or measure theory, so
  I am an unlikely choice of referee.) But I worry that the arXiv blog
  has as much visibility as all but the best journals, so it is a major
  problem if it singles out something like this. For example, your
  software tells me that 111 people are reading this right now. How many
  people are reading the Bulletin of the AMS right now?</p>
  
  <p>May I ask what procedure the arXiv blog uses to vet the papers it
  recommends? I would hope that they are sent out to experts for quick
  opinions as to general merit (similar to the ones JAMS and other top
  math journals solicit before beginning the reviewing process).</p>
