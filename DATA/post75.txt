<p>Every abelian variety is an Albanese variety: in fact, every abelian variety is <em>its own</em> Albanese variety.  Thus asking about BSD "for Albanese varieties" is equivalent to asking about BSD for all abelian varieties: i.e., the general case.</p>

<p>The story might change if you want to restrict the class of varieties $V$ you want to take the Albanese variety of.  In particular one is probably in slightly better shape looking at Jacobians -- i.e., Albanese varieties of curves -- than arbitrary abelian varieties, although in any case very little is known about BSD for anything but elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ of analytic rank at most $1$.  </p>
