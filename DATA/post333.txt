## Body:
<p>I'm looking for a result (embarrassingly enough, a somewhat famous result) which shows the infinitude in some sense I don't recall of primes of the form
$$
\lfloor x^k\rfloor
$$
for $k$ fixed and irrational. There were sharp limits on the size of $k.$ I think the original result has been improved many times, mostly by widening the allowable range of $k.$</p>
