## Body:
<p>I will be doing a project on factorising large integers and the standard book people keep recommending to me is Henri Cohen's book "A Course in Computational Algebraic Number Theory". It is in fact quite a good read, but it is also fairly old.</p>

<p>So my questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Are there any <em>recent</em> publications that deal with factorising large integers, specifically the quadratic sieve and/or number field sieve? Introductory as well as advanced publications would be great.</li>
<li>Since I also want to implement a few algorithms I need a good/fast/reliable multi-precision package (preferably for C/C++) which is suited for calculation with large integers.</li>
</ol>

<p>I would appreciate any kind of suggestions.</p>
