<p>I am a high school student and would like to pursue a career in mathematics and I am hoping to find a serious explanatory book on math (geometry, algebra, calculus, functions and trigonometry) for further advanced studies in math. Does anyone know any  very good textbooks that will truly make me a better mathematician?</p>
