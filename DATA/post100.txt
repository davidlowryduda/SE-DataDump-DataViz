<p>Here is an answer to your question in the context of DVRs.</p>

<p>The argument with ramification filtrations from Serre shows that
if $L/K$ is tame, then $Gal(L/K)$ embeds into $\mathcal O_L^{\times}/(1+\mathfrak
m_L)$, and hence is cyclic (being isomorphic to a finite subgroup of the multiplicative group of a field).  Since $K$ contains all prime-to-$p$ power roots of $1$, by the strict Henselian assumption (here $p$ is the char. of the 
residue field $\mathcal O_K/\mathfrak m_K$), we see that $L/K$ is a Kummer extension, i.e. obtained by extracting the $n$th root of some element of $K$,
for some $n$ prime to $p$. Again by strict Henselianess, the $n$th root
of all elements of $O_K^{\times}$ already lie in $K$ (using the fact that
$n$ is prime-to-$p$), and so in fact $L$ comes by extracting the $n$th root
of a uniformizer of $\mathcal O_K$.</p>

<p>If I can get my thoughts in order, I might come back and address the non-DVR
aspects of the question as well.</p>
