  <p><a href="http://sbseminar.wordpress.com/2009/05/13/thoughts-on-graduate-school/#comment-5581">Pete Clark recommends</a> the "1958 paper of Lang and Tate, on Galois cohomology of abelian varieties", which I believe refers to the paper <a href="http://boxen.math.washington.edu/edu/2010/582e/refs/lang-tate-principal_homogeneous_spaces_over_abelian_varieties.pdf">Principal Homogeneous Spaces over Abelian Varieties</a>. I assume this is classified as arithmetic geometry?</p>
