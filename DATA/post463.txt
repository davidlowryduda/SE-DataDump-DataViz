## Body:
<p>I am using Sobol sequence as random number generator in a computer program.</p>

<p>Beyond just making the program work, I would like to learn the mathematics behind the Sobol sequence (and other quasi-random sequences).</p>

<p>I understand that the Sobol sequence is based on finite field, but I have not found any introductory finite field book with applications on quasi-random sequence.</p>

<p>May I ask for some related book/links on this specific topic?</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
