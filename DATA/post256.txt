<p>For many "classical" equations, Leonard E Dickson's "History of the Theory of Numbers" vol 2 is still very useful. But that was published in the 1920s, and is inevitably miles out of date for some equations (including doubtless many of those it mentions).</p>

<p>Some years later someone, possibly Adrian Albert, published an updated version of Dickson's work with long bibliographies a-la Dickson; but I think that mostly covered more technical aspects of algebraic number theory rather than the classsical equations of Dickson's vol 2.</p>

<p>I imagine a complete catalog and bibliography today, bang up to date but in the same detail as Dickson, would require dozens of volumes and would be more a WIkipedia style project than anything one could reasonably contemplate publishing in book form.</p>
