<p>The wikipedia entry for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Heegner" rel="nofollow">Kurt Heegner</a> contains a reference to an article by Harold Stark where he adresses the gap on the original proof and presents an outline of Heegner's argument.</p>

<p>Heegner's original article (cited in the wikipedia entry) seems to be available in SpringerLink if you have access to it. </p>

<p>Another nice reference which you would like to consult is David Cox's excellent book <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0471190799" rel="nofollow">Primes of the form $x^2 + ny^2$</a>. In section 12 of that book you can find a proof under the entry <strong>E. Imaginary Quadratic Fields of Class Number 1</strong>. I hope this helps.</p>
