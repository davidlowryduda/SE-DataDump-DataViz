<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Conjecture</strong>:<br>
  Suppose $p$, $q$ are distinct primes, and define $\ f(n) = n p, \ 
 g(n) = \left \lfloor \frac{n}{q} \right \rfloor$ for all $n \in
 \mathbb{N_+}$; then <br>for all $x,y \in \mathbb{N_+}$, there exists a composition $F = g \circ g \circ \cdots \circ g \circ f \circ f \cdots \circ f$ such that $ \ y = F(x) $.</p>

<p>A weaker conjecture is implicit in the title question -- same as above, but allowing compositions with the functions in <em>arbitrary</em> order. </p>

<p>If this is something well-known or discussed elsewhere, my apologies (I did search); a reference would then be welcome. </p>

<p>(An analogous <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=443037" rel="nofollow">conjecture by Donald Knuth</a> involving factorial and integer-squareroot functions suggested this question.)</p>
