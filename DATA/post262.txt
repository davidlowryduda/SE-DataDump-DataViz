## Body:
<p>I cannot seem to find the formal statement of the theorem if there are infinite perfect numbers in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a> or online. I searched this site but the closest is the <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/22366/a-question-on-a-generalization-of-perfect-numbers">generalization of perfect numbers</a> question dealing with group theory.</p>

<p>Where can I find resources relating to the computability aspect of perfect numbers? </p>
