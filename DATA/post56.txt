<p>Broadly speaking, the information you gave in your question is up-to-date: ever since Gauss, number theorists have believed there should be infinitely many real quadratic fields of class number one, but we are not any closer to being able to prove this than Gauss was, to the best of my knowledge.  Moreover you have identified the key problem: the fact that a real quadratic field has an infinite unit group means that there is an additional quantity in the analytic class number formula, the <strong>regulator</strong>, which is not present in the imaginary quadratic case, and it is hard to separate out the respective contributions of the class number and regulator.</p>

<p>In recent years a trend of research has been towards making increasingly precise quantitative <em>conjectures</em> about the expected behavior of the class number -- or class group -- of a real quadratic field of discriminant $D$.  A lot of this comes under the heading of <strong>Cohen-Lenstra heuristics</strong>.  </p>

<p>Since you asked for some pointers to recent work, here are two interesting papers that I found (from a google search, I fully admit):</p>

<p>I. <a href="http://www.math.uga.edu/~pete/Stephens-Williams88.pdf" rel="nofollow">Stephens and Williams</a>, <em>Computation of real quadratic fields with class number one</em>.</p>

<p>II. <a href="http://www.math.wisc.edu/~ono/reprints/046.pdf" rel="nofollow">Ono</a>, <em>Indivisibility of class numbers of real quadratic fields</em>.</p>

<p>There is certainly plenty more literature available.  A MathSciNet search for "class number" AND "real quadratic field" calls up precisely [well, not for long!] 500 papers...</p>
