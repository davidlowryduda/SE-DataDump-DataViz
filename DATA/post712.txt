<p>I'm currently reading <em>Integer Partitions</em> by Andrews and Eriksson. In the introductory chapter (p.2), there is the following statement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... The table would have a more efficient design:<br>
  \begin{array}{r|r}
 1 + 1&amp; 2\\  
 1 + 1 +1 &amp; 3\\
 3 &amp; 2+1\\  
 1+1+1+1&amp;4  \\ 
 3+1 &amp; 3+1
 \end{array}</p>
  
  <p>The fact that there will always be as many items in the left column as in the right one was first proved by Leonhard Euler in 1748.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which proof by Euler are they talking about?</p>
