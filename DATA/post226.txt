<p>The phenomenon you describe seems to be the concept behind the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes" rel="nofollow">Sieve of Eratosthenes</a>.</p>

<p>Every number below $ \sqrt{N} $ where $ N $ is the number you want to factorize will appear at least once in the list of possible factors. Looking at the list generated by the Sieve, it will become obvious that only primes remain. A factorization using the Sieve then implies trial division by the primes up to $ \sqrt{N}$. This concept lets us see that obviously, if "many" small primes were used to remove elements in the Sieve, the remaining elements will have larger prime factors, possibly being primes themselves.</p>

<p>However: no generalization of any kind is possible, since every number's occurence is cyclic. Think of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform" rel="nofollow">Fourier Transform</a> , using prime factors as frequencies. 2 appears every second number, 3 every third and so on. At any point $N$, there is no way to determine if there are primes nearby of if the numbers nearby will have "large primes" as factors without it's value.</p>

<p>I could also relate what you're saying to the concept of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_prime" rel="nofollow">Mersenne Primes</a>. Essentially, primes in the form $2^{n}–1$ the largest known being $(2^{43,112,609} – 1)$, which also happens to be the largest prime known. In this case, they are looking for primes in the viscinity of exponents of 2, which is also saying the that largest factor is a large prime, right?</p>

<p>So yes, it stands to reason that if $N$ isn't a prime and has small factors, numbers nearby have a chance to have greater factors. No quantification of that is useful, however.</p>
