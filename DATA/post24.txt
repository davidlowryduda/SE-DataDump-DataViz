<p>I took number theory this semester and loved it but don't feel like I learned all that much. I am not going any farther in formal education in math so I would like to further investigate number theory on my own. Do you have any suggestions for good books? I need at least one that is pretty basic and preferably one that goes a little bit more advanced. (You can look at some of my other recent questions to see the level that I'm at, but I really don't understand much beyond Diophantine equations- pretty much have to start over).</p>

<p>I also would prefer if you didn't recommend current textbooks- I've got a pretty small budget. I was looking at <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0486656209" rel="nofollow">Ore's Number Theory and its History</a>, <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/048646931X" rel="nofollow">this book</a>, and <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0817645659" rel="nofollow">this book</a>. </p>

<p>Thanks for the help and I apologize if this question is too broad/vague/or subjective.</p>
