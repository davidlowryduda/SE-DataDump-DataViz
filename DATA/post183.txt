<p>pki's suggestion is good. A couple of other books worth a look are Pollard and Diamond, The Theory of Algebraic Numbers (in the MAA Carus Mathematical Monographs series), and Stewart and Tall, Algebraic Number Theory. Ireland and Rosen, A Classical Introduction to Modern Number Theory, doesn't get as far into algebraic number theory as the others, but it is well-written and has a chapter on cyclotomic fields and a chapter on Bernoulli numbers. </p>
