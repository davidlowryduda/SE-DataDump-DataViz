<p>Yes, there is, but it is quite technical (at least the one I know), and at the same time sooooo beautiful! I suggest you read the first 30-40 pages of Davenport's Multiplicative Number Theory. It illustrates the ideas of Dirichlet and if you go through the details, not only you will enjoy the proof, but learn a lot of ideas that emerged from number theory.</p>

<p>Hope that helps,</p>
