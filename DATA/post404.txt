## Body:
<p>I have seen a proof for FLT, $n=3$ using factorisation in the ring of Eisenstein integers, but it's quite long and convoluted; I am wondering if there is a more 'advanced' proof which avoids infinite descent/messy repeated calculations. </p>

<p>What's your favorite proof of Fermat's last theorem for $n=3$, and where can it be found written down?</p>
