<p>I was reading a sort of mini-bio on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Joseph_Sylvester" rel="nofollow">Sylvester</a> the other day and a "Theory of Compound Partitions" was mentioned in the discussion of his research interests. I wanted to ask, is this the same or the precursor to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_partition" rel="nofollow">Partitions</a> from Number Theory today? Thanks to all in advance.</p>
