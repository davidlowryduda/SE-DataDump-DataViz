## Body:
<p>I am interested in knowing whether an exact formula (analogous to the Hardy-Ramanujan-Rademacher formula for $p(n)$) for the number of partitions of a positive integer into k parts is known. I tried searching on the internet but could not find such a formula. Can someone confirm whether such a formula is known and provide a link to its proof if possible.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
