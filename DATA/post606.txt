<p>I am working on the following problem.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Find the number of the elements of order 4 in $(\mathbb Z/525\mathbb Z)^\times$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I tried to solve it in the following way: since $525=3\cdot5^2\cdot7$, we have by the CRT
$$
(\mathbb Z/525\mathbb Z)^\times \cong (\mathbb Z/3\mathbb Z)^\times \times
(\mathbb Z/25\mathbb Z)^\times \times (\mathbb Z/7\mathbb Z)^\times.
$$</p>

<p>By the fact stated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_group_of_integers_modulo_n" rel="nofollow">a Wikipedia article</a>, the consituent groups on the RHS are isomorphic to the cyclic groups of order 2, 20, 6, respectively.  Thus, the order of an element in $(\mathbb Z/525\mathbb Z)^\times$ is the least common multiple of some subset $S\subset\{2, 20, 6\}$, which can never be 4. In conclusion, the number of the elements of order 4 in $(\mathbb Z/525\mathbb Z)^\times$ is 0.</p>

<p>My question is whether my reasoning is correct (which I doubt because the result is so trivial). I would also like to ask where accessible proofs of the fact on Wikipedia (preferably on the Web) can be found.</p>

<p>I would appreciate your help.</p>
