<p>I recommend <em>Primes of the Form x<sup>2</sup> + ny<sup>2</sup></em>, by David Cox.  The question of which primes can be written as the sum of two squares was settled by Euler.  The more general question turns out to be much harder, and leads you to more advanced techniques in number theory like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_field_theory">class field theory</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_multiplication">elliptic curves with complex multiplication</a>.</p>
