<p>Let $p$ be an odd prime. If $a$ not congruent to $0$ modulo $p$, the congruence $x^2\equiv a\pmod {p}$ has two solutions or none.  </p>

<p>This means that viewed as a function on the non-zero elements of $\mathbb{Z}_p$, the squaring function is $2$ to $1$, meaning that its range has cardinality $(p-1)/2$.</p>

<p><strong>Remark:</strong> The fact that if there is a solution, there are exactly $2$, is true in all fields $F$ of characteristic different from $2$.  For suppose that in the field $F$, we have $a=b^2$, where $a\ne 0$. Then the equation $x^2=b^2$ can be rewritten as $(x-b)(x+b)=0$, so its only solutions are $b$ and $-b$, which are different unless $F$ has characteristic $2$.</p>
