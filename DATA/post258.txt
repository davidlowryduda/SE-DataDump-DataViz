<p>I haven't studied maths since my engineering degree some 15 years ago.  </p>

<p>At the time, I enjoyed maths and found it quite easy.  However, now I feel that I have lost everything I learnt and I'm really struggling to re-learn my lost knowledge.</p>

<p>Through my work, I'm currently quite interested in Cryptography and would like a basic understanding of the Maths behind it</p>

<p>Is number theory a good place to start re-learning maths, or should I go right back to the basics and re-learn algebra, trig, calculus, etc., first?  If I should go back to the basics, what is the normal order in which subjects are learnt?</p>
