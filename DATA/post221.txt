## Body:
<p>I am reading Serre's "Local Fields". I would like to find more exercises to complement my study. So I am looking for, mabye, exercises from a course that followed this book.</p>

<p>Do you know of such a course with exercises available online? Do you know about some exercises which correspond to the very first chapter (which treats Dedekind domains from the local point of view)? 
Do you have any suggestions regarding learning from this book, or learning local class field theory in general?</p>
