## Body:
<p>It was mentioned to me briefly in passing about a criterion for rings of integers, referred to as Dedekind's Criterion. </p>

<p>The Criterion essentially said that a ring $\mathbb{Z}[\omega]$ (for $\omega=\sqrt[3]{2}$ for example) is $p$-maximal (in it's fraction field I believe) if and only if the greatest common divisor of certain polynomials reduced modulo $p$ was equal to $1$, (or a constant). These polynomial are related to the prime $p$ in question, but I can't recall how.</p>

<p>I know this is terribly vague, but is anyone aware of a result that goes by Dedekind's criterion that sounds like this? I've been searching for it every, but have had no luck locating it or it's formulation. Does anyone have a possible reference?</p>
