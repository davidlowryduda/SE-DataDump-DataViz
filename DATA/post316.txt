<p>I know a little bit about basic number theory, much about algebra/analysis, I've read most of Niven &amp; Zuckerman's "Introduction to the theory of numbers" (first 5 chapters), but nothing about analytic number theory. I'd like to know if there would be a book that I could find (or notes from a teacher online) that would introduce me to analytic number theory's classical results. Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Thanks for the tips,</p>
