<p>I'm looking for an introductive book on Modular Forms and their applications to Algebraic Geometry and Algebraic Number Theory.</p>

<p>Some Ideas?</p>

<p>Explaining you my prerequisites, I've a good knowledge of basic instruments of Algebra and Algebraic Geometry, but I need some explanations in geometrical facts about Riemann Surfaces and Advanced Complex Analysis...</p>
