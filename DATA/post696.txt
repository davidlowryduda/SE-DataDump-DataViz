<p>Another interesting book: <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0521575400" rel="nofollow"><strong>A Pathway Into Number Theory - Burn</strong></a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>[B.B]</strong> The book is composed entirely of exercises leading the reader through
  all the elementary theorems of number theory. Can be tedious (you get
  to verify, say, Fermat's little theorem for maybe $5$ different sets of
  numbers) but a good way to really work through the beginnings of the
  subject on one's own.</p>
