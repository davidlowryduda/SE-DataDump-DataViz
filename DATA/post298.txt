## Body:
<p>I was recently reading this paper by <a href="http://swc.math.arizona.edu/aws/2001/01Weston1.pdf" rel="nofollow">Weston</a>, whereby he talks about the modular curves $X_0(11)$ and $X_1(11)$. </p>

<p>I was wondering if anyone can recommend a more general exposition of modular curves (specifically ones that are related to elliptic curves)? </p>
