<p>What are the topics which an undergraduate with knowledge of algebra, galois theory and analysis learn to understand Langlands program and its goemetric counterpart? I would also like to know what are the good books for these topics, in what order these material should be learned and what are the prerequisites?
What is the approximate amount of time required to master these material ? Also, any other helpful suggestions.</p>
