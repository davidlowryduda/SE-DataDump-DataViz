<p>I was reading this <a href="http://deweger.xs4all.nl/papers/%5B25%5DdW-ABCSha-QuJMathOxf%5B1998%5D.pdf" rel="nofollow">paper</a> by de Weger and in conjecture 7 he mentions "the Riemann hypothesis for the Rankin-Selberg zeta function associated to the weight 3/2 modular form associated to E (an elliptic curve over $\mathbb{Q}$) by the Shintani-Shimura lift is true."</p>

<p>I didn't really understand this statement so I was hoping if someone could explain it to me. So far I've found this <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1007.4310.pdf" rel="nofollow">paper</a> on the Rankin-Selberg zeta function. Is this just a statement about the zeros of the Rankin-Selberg zeta function? Also how is this zeta function associated to the elliptic curve? An expository reference would be appreciated.</p>
