<p>From the <a href="http://www.maa.org/publications/maa-reviews/opera-de-cribro" rel="nofollow">MAA website</a>:</p>

<p>"The book’s title is Latin and may be translated freely as “Sieve Theory: The Musical.” While the musical jokes and puns may not have you tapping your toes to the music of the primes, the book is a chatty and relatively painless way to get up to date on sieve theory. Our understanding of sieves has improved greatly over the past 20 or 30 years, in large part due to the efforts of this book’s two authors, and proofs that used to take many pages in an almost incomprehensible notation can now be done cleanly in one page..."</p>

<p>Edit:
<a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=isbn:0821849700" rel="nofollow">You can also see quite a few pages from the book on Google Books</a></p>

<p>Edit2:
Nobody seems to have picked up on the outrageous pun in the MAA reviewer's free translation ...</p>
