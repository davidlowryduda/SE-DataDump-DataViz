<p>Perhaps "best ever" is putting it a bit strong, but for me one of the best besides L E Dickson's books was "Elementary Number Theory" by B A Venkov, which does have an <a href="http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/1926394" rel="nofollow">English translation</a>. </p>

<p>One advantage of this book is that it covers an unusual and quite eclectic mix of topics, such as a chapter devoted to Liouville's methods on partitions, and some of these are hard to find in other texts.</p>

<p>The best benefit for me, paradoxically, was that the English translation I worked with was littered with misprints, in places a dozen or more per page. So after a while it became quite an enjoyable challenge to find them, and this meant having to study and consider the text more closely than one might have done otherwise!</p>
