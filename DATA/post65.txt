## Body:
<p>I have Lang's 2 volume set on "Cyclotomic fields", and Washington's "Introduction to Cyclotomic Fields", but I feel I need something more elementary. Maybe I need to read some more on algebraic number theory, I do not know.</p>

<p>So I would appreciate suggestions of books, or chapters in a book, lecture notes, etc. that would give me an introduction. I am specifically interested in connection of cyclotomic fields and Bernoulli numbers.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
