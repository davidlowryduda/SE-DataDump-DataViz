<p>Unfortunately, no letters written either <em>by</em> Eratosthenes or <em>to</em> Archimedes have been preserved. </p>

<p>There is a letter from Archimedes to Eratosthenes which describes <a href="http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Cattle/Statement.html" rel="nofollow">Archimedes' Cattle Problem</a>. The problem described by Dudley is obviously a modern follow-up on this problem. </p>
