<p>I would recommend Stewart and Tall's <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1568811195">Algebraic Number Theory and Fermat's Last Theorem</a> for an introduction with minimal prerequisites. For example you don't need to know any module theory at all and all that is needed is a basic abstract algebra course (assuming it covers some ring and field theory). But again the first chapter gives a quick review of the basic material from abstract algebra that is used later on.</p>

<p>I have used this book when I took an introductory course in Algebraic Number Theory and the experience was really good. The book has many examples and the pace is not too fast.</p>

<p>Most other books I have seen rely more heavily on module theory to make the exposition more general but since probably you don't have that background yet then I guess that this book may very well suit you perfectly.</p>
