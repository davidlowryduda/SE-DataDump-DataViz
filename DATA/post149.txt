<p>From the section <strong>Open Problems</strong> in the article <a href="http://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/07/02/connect-the-stars/" rel="nofollow"><strong>Connect the Stars</strong></a> by Kenneth Regan:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Finally, we offer an intriguing open problem about how fast we can multiply integers. It is possible to multiply integers very fast if they are represented via the Chinese Remainder Theoremâ€”though perhaps still not in linear time. Alas while addition and multiplication are fast in this representation, it seems to make it harder to compare two numbers. Thus a natural question is:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>Does there exist a representation of integers so that addition, multiplication, and comparison are all doable in linear time? Basically, is there a linear time discretely ordered ring?</p>

<p>I found this very intriguing.</p>

<ul>
<li>How can integers be represented via the Chinese Remainder Theorem?</li>
<li>How can they be multiplied?</li>
</ul>
