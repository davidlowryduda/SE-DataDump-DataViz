<p>I note that <a href="http://oeis.org/A020463" rel="nofollow">Primes that contain digits 3 and 7 only</a> are tabulated at the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. My understanding is that there is no set $D$ of fewer than 10 digits for which it has been proved that there are infinitely many primes which use only the digits in $D$. </p>
