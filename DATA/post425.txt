<p>The <strong><em>Art of Problem Solving</em></strong> (AOPS.org) has a website with abundant <a href="http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Wiki/index.php/Number_theory#Student_Guides_to_Number_Theory" rel="nofollow"><strong>links to number theory resources</strong></a>,  (guides, exercises, reference recommendations) to begin studying number theory, at varying levels of difficulty - from very basic, to progressively more difficult. E.g., To start, see AOPS's <a href="http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Wiki/index.php/Number_theory/Introduction" rel="nofollow"><strong>Introductory Topics in Number Theory</strong></a>: </p>

<p>"The following topics make a good introduction to number theory:"</p>

<pre><code>Primes
    Sieve of Eratosthenes
    Prime factorization 
Composite numbers
Divisibility
    Divisors
        Common divisors
            Greatest common divisors 
        Counting divisors 
    Multiples
        Common multiples
            Least common multiples 
Division Theorem (the Division Algorithm)
Base numbers
Diophantine equations
    Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick 
Modular arithmetic
    Linear congruence 
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Not necessarily directly related to number theory, but more foundational in nature to help prepare you for studying it, see the following</p>

<p>For some background reading in you listed topics: "sets, logic, and reasoning," and to better understand proof-reading/writing (with number theory as examples), you might want to start with </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Velleman's <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0521675995" rel="nofollow"><strong><em>How to Prove It: A Structured Approach</em></strong></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Mason, Burton, and Stacey's <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0273728911" rel="nofollow"><strong><em>Thinking Mathematically</em></strong></a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Together, they provide both structural knowledge (the "basics" of "building blocks"), and examples and exercises to get your "mind rolling" and to develop agility in your reasoning.</p>

<p>You can preview each of the books at the links above.</p>
