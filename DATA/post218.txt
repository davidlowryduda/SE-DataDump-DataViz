## Body:
<p>The <strong>Stark-Heegner theorem</strong> states that the ring of integers of the quadratic number field $\mathbb Q(\sqrt{m})$, where $m$ is a squarefree negative integer, is a principal ideal domain, iff
$$m\in\{-1,-2,-3,-7,-11,-19,-43,-67,-163\}$$
I am looking for special cases of this theorem (including references where I can find them), which can be proven with elementary number theory or not-too-complicated algebraic number theory.</p>

<p>This is what I have so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>$\mathbb Q(\sqrt{m})$ is a PID for $m\in\{-1,-2,-3,-7,-11\}$ (It is easy to prove, that this rings are norm-Euclidean and that Euclidean rings are PIDs)</li>
<li>$\mathbb Q(\sqrt{m})$ is a PID for $m\in\{-19,-43,-67,-163\}$ (Either prove, hat the norm is a Dedekindâ€“Hasse norm for these rings, or that, if Euler's prime generating polynomial $x^2+x+q$ generates primes for $x=0,\dots q-1$, then  $\mathbb Q(\sqrt{1-4q})$ is a PID)</li>
<li>If $m\not\equiv 1 \bmod 4$ and $m&lt;-2$, then $\mathbb Q(\sqrt{m})$ is not a PID (Again, there are several proofs, one of them is <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/310721/conclude-that-mathbbz-sqrtn-is-not-a-ufd">this one</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Does anyone know any other simple result in the above spirit, particulary for proving that some rings are <em>not</em> PIDs? Maybe something like a proof, that there are only finitely many PIDs, maybe even an upper bound for $m$, or the fact that $m\equiv 1\bmod{8}$ does not work, or maybe some other restriction on $m$? </p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> All Heegner numbers are prime. Maybe, there is some argument, why it won't work for composite numbers?</p>
