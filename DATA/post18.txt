<p>You can find the <a href="http://www.maths.unsw.edu.au/~angell/5535/chapter7.ps">proofs here</a>, taken from Chrystal's Algebra - which is one of the best references on continued fractions. I suspect that if you read Chrystal then almost all of your questions will be answered. See also chapter 9 of Fowler's "The mathematics of Plato's Academy" </p>
