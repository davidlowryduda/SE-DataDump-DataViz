<p>I know that professor Andrew Wiles discovered his proof of Fermat's Last Theorem in 1995. One of my friends is looking for a text which provides his proof. I know that the proof is very complicated and uses difficult methods to get the solution, but I hope that you can give me the name of a text which contains it (or a link to the proof or such a text :)) I would also like to know what prerequisites are needed to study/understand the proof in detail? Furthermore, has anyone else discovered another proof since Wiles, or is Andrew Wiles' proof the only known solution?</p>

<p>thanks </p>
