## Body:
<p>I spent some time today looking for <em>any</em> biographical information on Jitsuro Nagura and came up empty-handed. Any suggestions welcome. </p>

<p>Also, the Wiki note on the Chebyshev $\psi$ function says that von Mangoldt proved in 1895 that</p>

<p>$\psi_0(x) = x - \sum_{\rho}\frac{x^{\rho}}{\rho}- \frac{\xi&#39;(0)}{\xi(0)}-\frac{1}{2}\ln(1-x^2) $</p>

<p>There is a reference to a 1903 note by E. Schmidt which may or may not contain a reference to the original paper, but my amateurish search (in Euclid, JSTOR) did not turn up anything. </p>

<p>Thanks in advance. </p>

<p>Edit: have changed the title to reflect that I am seeking information on J. Nagura and have found the other reference. Thanks. </p>
