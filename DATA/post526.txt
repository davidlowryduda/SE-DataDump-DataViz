<p>I'm looking for literature on solving problems of the form
$$
n_1^\alpha+\cdots+n_k^\alpha=(n_1+\cdots+n_k)^\beta
$$
for positive integers $n_1,\ldots,n_k$ and fixed parameters $k$ and $\alpha\ne\beta.$ Any ideas?</p>

<p>This is perhaps similar to multigrade equations or "equal sums of like powers" but not quite similar enough to use those results (as far as I can see). But surely this is too simple not to have been studied?</p>
