<p>For the equations
$$x+y+z=31$$ $$x+2y+3z=41$$
is there a elegant way or method to find all the positive solutions in integers? Thus far, I have been using trial and error (which is time consuming). Another approach I tried was subtracting the first equation from the second to get $y+2z=10$. But I feel like there must be some faster way of doing this that I am not thinking of right now. Any input is appreciated.</p>
