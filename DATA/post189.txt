<p>That xkcd strip is not about number theory, but about set theory (and a particularly slippery part of set theory at that; the Axiom of Choice is tricky!). </p>

<p>A possible first set theory book might be Halmos's <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0387900926" rel="nofollow"><em>Naive Set Theory</em></a>, though it can be tough in parts and suffers somewhat for having few exercises.</p>

<p>There are several introductory Number Theory books; e.g., William Stein's <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1441927522" rel="nofollow"><em>Elementary Number Theory: Primes, Congruences and Secrets</em></a>; Leveque's <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0486663485" rel="nofollow"><em>Elementary Number Theory</em></a>; and <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/048646931X" rel="nofollow">Underwood Dudley's book of the same title</a>. </p>
