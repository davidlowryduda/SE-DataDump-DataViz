## Body:
<p>I have been going around various questions based on number theory in this forum, and what I have found is that congruencies serve as an important tool in many of the questions and actually simplify the solution in case multiple solutions exist.</p>

<p>My question is that for these properties, can I find a book collecting these? Or is it just that I need to keep remembering them as I come across a new property every now and then?</p>
