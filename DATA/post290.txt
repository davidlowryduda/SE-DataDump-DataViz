## Body:
<p>Could someone please point me in the direction of a proof for Landau's asymptotic formula for k-almost primes:</p>

<p>$$\pi_k(n) \sim \left( \frac{n}{\log n} \right) \frac{(\log\log n)^{k-1}}{(k - 1)!}$$</p>

<p>I realise that it was derived directly from the PNT - would like to see the steps involved though. </p>
