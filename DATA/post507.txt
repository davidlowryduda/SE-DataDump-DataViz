<p>Concerning Diophantine analysis I learned much in a nice little book of Edward Burger : <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=2l_PKJ5075kC&amp;pg=PA1" rel="nofollow">'Exploring the Number Jungle'</a>.</p>

<p>Concerning Number Theory from a novice level the venerable Hardy &amp; Wright's <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=rey9wfSaJ9EC&amp;pg=PA1" rel="nofollow">'Introduction to Number Theory'</a> had to be cited.</p>
