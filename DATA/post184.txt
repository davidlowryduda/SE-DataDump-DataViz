<p>In other words, are the primes occuring in the sequence
$$M_n=2^n-1$$
or the recursive realtion
$$M(n+1)=2\times M(n)+1$$
useful in other fields of mathematics to solve problems or appear in the definition of other important functions?</p>

<p>I apologize in advance for any mistakes in my English, I hope that the translator did a good job :).</p>
