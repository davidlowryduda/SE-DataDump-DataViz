<p>I'd suggest not to "prepare" but just to dig in. Keeping in mind that if the going gets rough, you might need to look for outside help (catch up on some stuff you aren't familiar with, fill in some gaps). Either through other texts, looking for lecture notes (the 'net is chock full of them, some awful, a few outstanding), look for formal classes at e.g. <a href="http://www.coursera.net" rel="nofollow">coursera</a>, or by bothering folks here.</p>

<p>"Preparing for" isn't very rewarding in itself. And you could easily "overlearn" stuff you won't need, or "misslearn" by not seeing how and where you will need it.</p>

<p>(Just my style. YMMV.)</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
