<p>My memory is that this is given as an exercise in Cassels and Frolich (the exercises were actually written by Serre and Tate).  One uses the fact that being a norm in a cyclic extension of number fields can be detected locally (the so-called Hasse norm theorem), which deals with the case of representations by binary quadratic forms.  Forms in more variables are then handled by induction. (Possibly I'm simplifying here, but this
is the basic idea.)</p>

<p>If I understand correctly, this is true to history: Hasse's contribution to the theorem was to prove it over number fields, using his norm theorem for cyclic extensions as the initial input.</p>
