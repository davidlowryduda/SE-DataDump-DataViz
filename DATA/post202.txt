## Body:
<p>I understand where I am wrong in my <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/92445/twin-prime-conjecture">previous post</a>. Also, I am very thankful to all members, who answered and showed my errors in post. Now, I would like to know the proof for the following. </p>

<p>"The difference of any two prime numbers $p$ and $q$ is expressible as $2k$; and the probability of finding primes $p$ at $n + k$ and $q$ at $n - k$ decreases as $n$ increases."</p>
