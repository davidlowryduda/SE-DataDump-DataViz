<p>Maple has a package called ellpack for handling elliptic curves. Also if you type $$\rm Cremona\quad elliptic$$ into the web, many useful links will appear. </p>

<p>I also recommend the <a href="http://www.inf.unideb.hu/~pethoe/cikkek/67_MORDELL.pdf" rel="nofollow">paper</a>, Gebel, Petho and Zimmer, On Mordell's equation. According to the summary, they solve Mordell for all $k$ up to 10,000, so you may be asking for a bit much if you want to go up to 1,000,000.  </p>
