<p>My favorite elementary number theory book is the one I published with Springer: <a href="http://wstein.org/ent/">http://wstein.org/ent/</a>   This isn't a completely shameless plug, because I was just allowed to release the PDF version legally for free (available at the above URL), which the original poster might appreciate. </p>
