<p>Here are a few proofs: <a href="http://www.math.uconn.edu/~kconrad/blurbs/ugradnumthy/4squarearithprog.pdf">1</a>, <a href="http://www.math.ku.dk/~kiming/lecture_notes/2007-2008-elliptic_curves/4_squares_in_arithmetic_progression.pdf">2</a> (which is excellent), and the somewhat bizarre <a href="http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath044/kmath044.htm">3</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there are no cases where you have nontrivial arithmetic progressions of higher powers. This is a string of proofs. Carmichael himself covered this for n = 3 and 4, about a hundred years ago. But it wasn't completed until Ribet wrote a paper on it in the 90s. His paper can be found <a href="http://math.berkeley.edu/~ribet/Articles/acta.pdf">here</a>. The statement is equivalent to when we let $\alpha = 1$. Funny enough, he happens to have sent out a notice on scimath with a little humor, which can still be found <a href="http://www.math.niu.edu/~rusin/known-math/96/fermatlike">here</a>.</p>
