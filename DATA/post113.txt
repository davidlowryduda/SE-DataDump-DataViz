<p>That's a good survey article on the Langland's program.  It's takes you through the historical perspective to Artin reciprocity and it's implications. If you look that over you'll get a good overview of what you need to know; class-field theory, L-functions, p-adic numbers, adeles, automorphic forms, and group representations.  To get a good handle on this stuff check out Frohlich and Taylor:</p>

<p>I have a copy of this book and in my opinion it is accessible to someone with a good course in Number Theory and perhaps two courses in Algebra at the grad level.  I don't think an undergrad is going to get there on his own but with guidance from an advisor working in number theory you can do it.</p>

<p>Now I'm no expert in Langlands but (I believe) the Langland's program is a series of conjectures that are basically consequences and generalizations of Artin reciprocity. </p>

<p>Give it a shot.  The Langlands program is some deep stuff that took on a role of the same magnitude as Klein's Erlanger program before it.  You really can't go wrong getting to the bottom of this one.</p>
