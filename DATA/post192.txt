## Body:
<p>Can anyone point me towards a good reference which contains the proof of the Hasse-Minkowski theorem of quadratic forms over a number field? Serre's "A Course in Arithmetic" has a self contained proof for the theorem when the base field is $\mathbb{Q}$, but I am looking for the more general setting.</p>
