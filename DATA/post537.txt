## Body:
<p>In <a href="http://www-nw.uni-regensburg.de/~knm22087/book.pdf" rel="nofollow">Specialization of Quadratic
and Symmetric Bilinear
Forms</a> (page: 3) the author writes "Let also $\lambda: K \to L \cup \infty$ be a place, $\mathfrak o = \mathfrak o_\lambda$ the valuation ring associated to $K$ and $\mathfrak m$ be the maximal ideal of $\mathfrak o$."</p>

<p>What is a <em>place</em> and what is $L$? This is the first page of the book so that knowledge of the definition seems to be assumed.   </p>
