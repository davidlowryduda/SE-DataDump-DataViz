<p>There are plenty of answers on past SE threads, but I'll recommend my favourite anyways:</p>

<p><em>The Higher Arithmetic</em> by H. Davenport is a quite difficult and very rigorous introduction, but is a wonderful text that can also serve as a reference. It assumes no prior knowledge at all and has exercises ranging from introductory to very difficult.</p>
