<p>By "higher dimensonal class field theory", Tate means the class field theory of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_local_field">higher dimensional local fields</a> (see also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_field#Higher_dimensional_local_fields">this brief discussion</a>), developed in the work of various people, including Kato and Parshin. </p>

<p>As for your second question, about learning CFT from a modern perspective: with my own students, I encourage them to learn from Cassels and Frolich (including the exercises), from Cox's book <em>Primes of the form $x^2 + n y^2$</em>, and from Washington's article on Galois cohomology in Cornell, Silverman, and Stevens.</p>

<p>The first reference (especially the main articles of Serre and Tate) gives a development of the main results of CFT which I think is hard to beat.  Cox's book gives an important classical perspective.  Washington's article gives insight into how class field theory can be reformulated as a collection of theorems (mainly due to Tate) on (local and global) Galois cohomology.</p>

<p>Tate's article <em>Number theoretic background</em> in the second volume of Corvalis is good when you have reached a certain level of sophistication, and are ready to move on from just focussing on algebraic number theory and CFT to a broader perspective.  My experience is that it is a little austere for a beginner, though.</p>

<p>One thing that you will be missing if you follow the above references is an $L$-function-based perspective on class field theory.  I gather that this is discussed in the new edition of Artin--Tate.  If so, it is worth learning, since although it is the more old-fashioned point of view on CFT, non-abelian class field theory (i.e. the Langlands program) is founded on the notion of $L$-functions.  (I believe that Lang's book also discusses the $L$-function approach to CFT, but I've never read it myself.)</p>
