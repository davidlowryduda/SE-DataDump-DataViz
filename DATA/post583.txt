<p>I am reading an article <a href="http://www.ias.edu/about/publications/ias-letter/articles/2012-summer/modular-arithmetic-taylor" rel="nofollow">Modular Arithmetic</a> by Richard Taylor.    I have 2 questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>For which $n$, $x^2+y^2=nz^2$ has nontravial solutions? What are the solutions?</p></li>
<li><p>A beautiful theorem of Hermann Minkowski and Helmut Hasse  says that if $Q (X_1 , ..., X_d ) $ is any homogeneous quadratic polynomial in any number of variables with whole number coefficients, then</p></li>
</ol>

<p>$$Q (X_1 , ..., X_d ) $$</p>

<p>has a non-zero solution in whole numbers if and only if it has a non-zero solution in all (real) numbers and a primitive solution modulo $m$ for all positive whole numbers $m$</p>

<p>How to prove the beautiful theorem? Could you recommend some books? </p>

<p>Many thanks in advance!</p>
