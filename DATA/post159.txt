<p>The first proof I ever saw of Fermat's theorem used the reduction theory of binary quadratic forms, i.e. expressions of the form $Q(x, y) = ax^2 + bxy + cz^2$ with $a,b,c \in \mathbf{Z}$. We say $Q$ <em>represents</em> $n$ if there are integers $x, y$ such that $Q(x, y) = n$. To $Q$ we can attach its <em>discriminant</em>, $b^2 - 4ac$; we're interested in forms whose discriminant is negative, which therefore do not represent any negative number.</p>

<p>The proof goes in two steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>the fact that -1 is a square mod p implies that p is represented by some binary quadratic form of discriminant -4;</li>
<li>every binary quadratic form of discriminant -4 can be reduced to $x^2 + y^2$ by a change of variables. </li>
</ul>

<p>Since changing variables doesn't alter the set of integers that a form represents, this shows that $x^2 + y^2$ represents $p$, i.e. $p$ is a sum of two squares. There is an account of this proof <a href="http://www.dms.umontreal.ca/~andrew/Courses/Chapter4.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a> (quite compressed, but not as much so as the one I just gave :-) ).</p>

<p>You may not like this since it proves Fermat's theorem without explicitly mentioning $\mathbf{Z}[i]$ at all, but you can of course deduce the criterion for irreducibility in $\mathbf{Z}[i]$ from Fermat's theorem. </p>
