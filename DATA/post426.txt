<p>Are there any books which teach commutative algebra and algebraic number theory at the same time. Many commutative algebra books contain few chapters on algebraic number theory at end. But I don't need that. I'm seaching for book which motivates commutative algebra using algebraic number theory.My main is to learn algebraic number theory but while doing so I also want to pick up  enough commutative algebra to deal with algebraic geometry as well.</p>
