<p>One of my colleagues, a number theorist, recommended the little book by van den eynden for beginners.  my favorite is by trygve nagell.  (I am a geometer.)  One of my friends, preparing for a PhD in arithmetic geometry?, started with the one recommended by Barry, Basic number theory.  As I recall it's for people who can handle Haar measure popping up on the first page of a "basic" book on number theory.</p>

<p>I also recommend Gauss's Disquisitiones Arithmeticae.</p>
