## Body:
<p>I'm just beginning to read the paper <a href="http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FBAZ%2FBAZ52_02%2FS0004972700014763a.pdf&amp;code=fef4a9ce48e1cb8e9a01ec5fab104dcd" rel="nofollow"><em>Finding Eisenstein Elements in Cyclic Number Fields of Odd Prime Degree</em></a>.*</p>

<p>On the third page, in Lemma 2, the author references Proposition 5.11 of David Cox's <em>Primes of the form $x^2+ny^2$</em>, (John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1989), which is apparently found on page 102. It deals with inert primes.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I don't have access to this book, and it is checked out at my local library for another 3 weeks. Could someone with access perhaps provide the proof of the proposition in question? I'd be very grateful.</p>

<p>*For some reason the link I copy from my browser doesn't seem to work as a link. Googling brings up the paper as the first result though.</p>
