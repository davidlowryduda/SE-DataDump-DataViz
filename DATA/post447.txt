<p>I hope this question is appropriate for this forum. I am compiling a list of all books about the Riemann Hypothesis and Riemann's Zeta Function. Here is my list:</p>

<p>The Riemann Hypothesis: A Resource for the Afficionado and Virtuoso Alike, Peter Borwein, Stephen Choi, Brendan Rooney, Andrea Weirathmueller (Eds.) </p>

<p>The Riemann Hypothesis and Hilbert's Tenth Problem, by S. Chowla</p>

<p>Prime Obsession: Bernhard Riemann and the Greatest Unsolved Problem in Mathematics, by John Derbyshire</p>

<p>The Music of the Primes: Searching to Solve the Greatest Mystery in Mathematics, by Marcus du Sautoy </p>

<p>Riemann's Zeta Function, by Harold M. Edwards</p>

<p>The Riemann Zeta-Function: Theory and Applications, by Aleksandar Ivic </p>

<p>The Riemann Zeta-Function, by Anatoly A. Karatsuba and S. M. Voronin</p>

<p>In Search of the Riemann Zeros, by Michel L. Lapidus</p>

<p>Limit Theorems for the Riemann Zeta-Function, by Antanas Laurincikas</p>

<p>The Lerch zeta-function, by Antanas Laurincikas and Ramunas Garunkstis</p>

<p>Spectral Theory of the Riemann Zeta-Function, by Yoichi Motohashi</p>

<p>An Introduction to the Theory of the Riemann Zeta-Function, by S. J. Patterson</p>

<p>Stalking the Riemann Hypothesis: The Quest to Find the Hidden Law of Prime Numbers, by Dan Rockmore</p>

<p>The Riemann Hypothesis: The Greatest Unsolved Problem in Mathematics, by Karl Sabbagh</p>

<p>Seminar on the Riemann Zeta Function 1965-1966, by Robert Spira</p>

<p>Zeta and q-Zeta Functions and Associated Series and Integrals, by H. M. Srivastava and Junesang Choi</p>

<p>The Theory of the Riemann Zeta-Function, by E. C. Titchmarsh, D. R. Heath-Brown (Ed.) </p>

<p>Zeta Functions over Zeros of Zeta Functions, by André Voros</p>

<p>Are any books missing from my list? I don't include books by mathematical cranks (especially books by amateurs who claim to prove RH in their book). I also don't include books about analytic number theory in general that include some material about the Riemann Hypothesis or Riemann's Zeta Function. I did not include books about related topics, such as zeta functions of groups. I realize that one could quibble about the inclusion of some of the books on my list, such as Laurincikas's book about the Lerch Zeta Function. I would be very grateful for any additions to my list.</p>

<p>Edit: Excluding books that consist of collections of mathematical tables, and books that are paper-length (say, under 50 pages), the following books can be added to my list:</p>
