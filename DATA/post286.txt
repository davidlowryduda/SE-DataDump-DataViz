Are the conjectural values of $H_{k}:=\lim\inf_{n\to\infty}p_{n+k}-p_{n}$ available somewhere?

## Body:
<p>The question is in the title. It can be found on the current Polymath 8b project page that one expects to have $H_{1}=2$, $H_{2}=6$, $H_{3}=8$, $H_{4}=12$ and $H_{5}=16$ but I'm interested in larger values. Could someome tell me where I can find them?<br>
Thanks in advance.</p>
