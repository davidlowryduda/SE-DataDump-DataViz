<p>In my work I have met the function on the unit circle whose Fourier coefficients are 
$$
c_n=\frac{1}{|n|}\prod (d_k+1)
$$
if $n=\pm\prod p_k^{d_k}$ is the decomposition of the integer $n$ into the product of prime numbers. The formal series of the function is
$$
\sum_{n\in\mathbb Z}c_nz^n.
$$
This function could have already appeared and I would much appreciate any references about it. (I am interested in properties of this function, but now it is not yet easy to say what I really need.)</p>
