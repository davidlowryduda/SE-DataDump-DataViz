<p>I'm a big fan of Murty and Esmonde's "Problems in algebraic number theory", which develops the basic theory through a series of problems (with the answers in the back).  Another nice sources in Milne's notes on algebraic number theory, available on his website <a href="http://www.jmilne.org/math/CourseNotes/ant.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
