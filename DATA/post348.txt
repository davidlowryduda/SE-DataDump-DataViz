<p>Let $f$ be a $1$-periodic function, i.e., $f(x+1)=f(x)$, defined on the interval $(0, 1)$ by the formula
$$
f(x)=2x-1.
$$
For a real number $x$ consider the series
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{f(nx)}{n}.
$$
It is easily seen that the series converges if $x$ is rational and if $f$ is assumed to vanish at all integers. </p>

<p>My question is: <em>does the convergence hold for irrational</em> $x$?</p>

<p>I would also be grateful for references to any results about kindred objects.</p>
