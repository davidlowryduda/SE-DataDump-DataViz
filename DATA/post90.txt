<p>This is also Theorem 2.41 in <strong>An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers</strong> (5th Edition) by Niven, Zuckerman, and Montgomery. The proof does not require Carmichael's function, though they do use Euler's totient function, defining a primitive root to be an element of multiplicative order $\phi(m)$ modulo $m$.</p>

<p>They first prove every prime $p$ has $\phi(p-1)$ primitive roots modulo $p$ (Theorem 2.36). Later, they show that if $p$ is a prime, then there are $\phi(\phi(p^2))$ primitive roots modulo $p^2$ (Theorem 2.39). Theorem 2.40 proves that if $p$ is an odd prime and $g$ is a primitive root modulo $p^2$, then $g$ is a primitive root modulo $p^{\alpha}$ for $\alpha\geq 2$. Then a discussion deals with the case of $p=2$, showing there are no primitive roots modulo $2^{\alpha}$ for $\alpha\geq 3$; finally, the composite numbers that are not prime powers nor twice prime powers are dealt with.</p>
