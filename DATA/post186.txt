<p>I would appreciate any suggestions for book or notes on ANT at a level that I would characterize as advanced beginner. I.e., something assuming familiarity with topics in Dummit &amp; Foote, that is a little less than Samuel or Marcus.</p>

<p>I would especially like accessible discussions of topics such as fractional ideals, ramification, and ideal classes. </p>

<p>Any suggestions would be appreciated. (I have seen several enthusiastic endorsements of Stewart and Tall.)</p>

<p>Thanks.   </p>
