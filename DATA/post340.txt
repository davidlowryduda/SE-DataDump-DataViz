## Body:
<p>My main question is the generalization, though one can answer the first one and it will get accepted.</p>

<ul>
<li>Are there infinitely many primes involving $3,7$ only?</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Generalization:</em> For what sets of given $k$ distinct digits (not all even) from $\{0,1,...,9\}$ where $1\leq k \leq 9,$ there are infinitely many prime numbers involving only these $k$ digits? </p>
