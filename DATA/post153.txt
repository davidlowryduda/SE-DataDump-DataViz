<p>This is a sub-problem of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunyakovsky_conjecture" rel="nofollow">Bunyakovsky conjecture</a>.  I have an interactive form of it at <a href="http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/TheBouniakowskyConjecture/" rel="nofollow">The Bouniakowsky Conjecture</a>.  Let $f$ be an integer-coefficient irreducible polynomial with degree higher than 2, and let $k=gcd(f(0),f(1))$. </p>

<p>The conjecture: $f(n)/k$ always generates an infinite number of primes.</p>

<p>Some polynomials, like $x^{12}+488669$ seem to only sparsely make prime numbers, but so far no bounds are known for any of these polynomials.</p>
