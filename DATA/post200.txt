<p>This is normally phrased as $[Cl^+(k):Cl^+(k)^2] = 2^{r-1}$, where $r$ is the number of primes dividing $\Delta$.  It is due to Gauss, and is proved in his famous book <em>Disquisitiones Arithmeticae</em> (which is available in English translation).  A more modern treatment can be found in the book <em>Advanced number theory</em>, by Harvey Cohn.</p>
